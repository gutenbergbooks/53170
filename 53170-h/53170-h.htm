<p>When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia
were instigated by Abdul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to investigate
into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abdul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
that the massacres of April, 1909, had been planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called “Liberal Turks” or “Young Turks.”</p>

<h2>WHY AND WHEREFORE.</h2>

<p>In making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence&mdash;Energy&mdash;Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.</p>

<p>After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacres.</p>

<p>The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can describe their horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.</p>

<p>The Armenians may be led again “as sheep to the slaughter” and the
work of extermination may be completed&mdash;Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord&mdash;but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirlwind.
It is in the natural order of things.</p>

<p>I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.</p>

<p>The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”</p>

<p class="caption">SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASIA MINOR.</p>

<p class="caption2">The trouble began in Adana. An armed mob strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neighbouring
villages were burned. The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
babe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.</p>

<h2>DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.</h2>

<p>I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="img3" style="width: 350px;">

<img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="350" height="225" alt="" />

<p class="caption">IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.</p>

<p class="caption2">History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hideously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered&mdash;25,000
in this province they say; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out. In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene, and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly everyone
in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down by the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.”</p>

<p>“For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers; they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”</p>

<p>“The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women and
children and old people.”&mdash;Extract from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Consul
at Adana; published in the London “Daily Mail.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The soldiers led the way in
these horrors and were guilty of
atrocities so terrible that they can
never be described in a public
print. Even the soldiers landed at
Mersina&mdash;the soldiers sent expressly
to restore order&mdash;added to the
crimes and for three days continued
the murders unchecked.”&mdash;Extract
from the London “Daily Mail.”</p>

<p>“The outbreak began in the
Armenian bazaar on April 14th,
and on the pretence that an Armenian
revolt was in progress the
Redifs or reserves were called out.
These, as villainous a crew as could
well be found, had arms and ammunition
served out to them, and
immediately joined in the slaughter,
and all the worst of the subsequent
killing, looting, and house burning
was done by them.”</p>

<p>“The Armenians did not take
their punishment lying down. Their
quarter of the town was so well
defended that the mob, mad as they
were with lust for blood, would not
venture into it. Houses on the outskirts
were besieged by thousands
of men and held by half a dozen; in
fact, the courage of these hordes of
Moslem savages was only equal to
butchering women and children and
unarmed men. I saw a Greek
house which was held for eight
hours by one Armenian with a shotgun
against hundreds of Turks firing
from the surrounding houses and
the minaret of a mosque. At last
his cartridges gave-out, but not for
two hours after that did the mob
pluck up courage to rush the
house.”&mdash;Extracts from accounts by Mr. J. L. C. Booth, special correspondent of the London
“Graphic.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Kessab was a thrifty Armenian town of about eight thousand
inhabitants, situated on the landward slope of Mt. Cassius (Arabic,
Jebel Akra) which stands out prominently upon the Mediterranean
seacoast half-way between Alexandretta and Latakia. Kessab is now a
mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churches and houses rising
up out of the ashes and charred timbers heaped on every side. What must
it mean to the five thousand men and women and little children who
have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and have now returned
to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned!
There were nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in
the valleys below. Several of these have been completely destroyed by
fire. All have been plundered and the helpless people driven out or
slain.”</p>

<p>“Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed
on foot the long trail up the mountain, and then as they came over
the ridge into full view of their charred and ruined dwellings? Their
stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had
been stolen; their silk industries stamped out; their beloved churches
reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of their friends and relatives
who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of home is so
strong that the people have settled down there with the determination
to clear up the debris and rebuild their houses.”&mdash;Extracts from
“The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van R. Trowbridge.</p>

</div>

<p>As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, “The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”</p>

<p>If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.</p>

<p>The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protection
for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO 2<span class="smcapuc">ND</span> PRINTING.</h2>

<p>The first and second parts of this little book were written and printed
in pamphlet form for circulation in the United States, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April, 1909. I have now thought it advisable to add
a Supplement of a short history of the Origin of the Armenians and the
Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.</p>

<p>The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals “Harper’s
Monthly,” “The Wide World” and the “Cosmopolitan” have been added
to the 2nd printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO 2<span class="smcapuc">ND</span> PRINTING.</h2>

<p>My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case of my unfortunate
race before the men and women of the United States; since it is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have gone forth, who
have been the only helping influence from without for my suffering people in
Asiatic Turkey. To the earnest and devoted men and women of the
American Missions, we Armenians owe a debt of gratitude which we can
never repay.</p>

<p>If in the contents of the pages of this little book I have exaggerated
Facts by one whit or one iota, if I have deviated by one hair’s breadth from
the Truth, I stand to be judged.</p>

<p>“God save us from another Adana, but the sword of Islam has not been
dulled” was one of the clarion notes sounded at the Sixth International
Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement, which was held at Rochester,
New York. The man who sounded that clarion note knew Islam, and
because knowing of my own knowledge that the sword of Islam has not been
dulled, I tremble lest its sharp edge fall once more on the neck of my helpless
race. If I knew and felt sure in mine own heart that the sword of Islam
was dulled, I would be content to let bygones be bygones, and to hold my
peace and be silent for ever.</p>

<p>Like the sudden explosion of a volcano in the physical world, comes the
explosion of a Turkish Massacre of Armenians in the moral world. It comes
just in that way; the subterranean fires are always there, but all of a sudden
the sulphur flames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and lust of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streams; the unfortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolting,
that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the human fiends is arrested. For the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satisfied; for the time being, the eye
is content with the scenes of havoc and desolation lying under the sun; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the “christian
swine” reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger’s victim: the tiger has eaten his fill, he rests,
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue left of those that have
served as the meat and wine of this devil’s feast; the demons have gorged
themselves over the banquet, and now there are left over the broken remains
of the banquet, the miserable residue homeless and destitute.</p>

<p>Civilized nations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion; the electric vibration running
far and wide from the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among
these civilized nations generous and kind-hearted people who open their
purse strings; they give money to purchase shelter, food and clothing for
these homeless, naked and hungry beggars, made homeless, naked and
hungry through no fault of their own. But oh! ye generous and kind hearted
people! can any power under heaven assuage the heart anguish of this
miserable residue? Can they be made by any means of human comfort to
forget the black horrors or recover from the effects of the fires of the hideous
affliction through which they have passed? What is there left for a woman
who has seen with her own eyes the slaughter and heard with her own ears
the dying cry of her murdered child? even her reason must give way under
the stress of her anguish. All ye who are mothers, I appeal to you, for one
moment to put yourselves in the place of thousands of such mothers, in
whose hearts the same mother’s love burns as in yours, and then measure
the depth of their agony.</p>

<p>Generous and kind hearted people who open your purse strings; would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that this hideous
slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should cease. Would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that this people
of an industrious, intelligent christian race, robust in mind and body, should
be let to live. Would to God I entreat, that ye would raise up your voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as equally as all other peoples.</p>

<p>Public Sentiment has done great things in the world’s history. Public
Sentiment liberated Greece, The Lebanon, The Balkan States from Turkish
Oppression. Slavery was abolished in the United States through Public
Sentiment: but alas! does Public Sentiment sleep for this helpless Christian
race. Are they not God’s creatures? have they not a right to live on God’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?</p>

<p>Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race. It is by Christian Governments that “we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.” It is
as if the answer to our groanings had been made by Christian Governments
in just these words:</p>

<p>“We know that you have had frightful grievances, such as have been
beyond the measure of human endurance. We know that since the Treaty
of Berlin your history has been written in blood and tears, as the history of
no other nation has been written before or now. We know that your women
are subjected to the most revolting and hideous agonies, and your babes
and children hounded to hideous deaths. We know that the sum total of
your wrongs and sufferings is so great, that the cry of its anguish is piercing
the very heavens, but really, our political and commercial jealousies prevent;
and we each one of us being on the look out lest our separate political and
commercial interests in the Empire of your oppressors be endangered, cannot
regard you. It may be the deadliest scandal of Christendom that we
Christian Powers should be all gathered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together round a carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must die hideously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political
and commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors.”</p>

<p>In “Transcaucasia and Ararat,” published by Mr. James Bryce in 1876,
there occurs in the chapter entitled “Some Political Reflections” the following
passage:</p>

<p>“The attention of the West was so much drawn towards Herzegovina
and Bulgaria by the events of 1876 that the miseries of the Asiatic subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been; and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some of
the more recent statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problem as that of Bulgaria itself.”</p>

<p>In the 4th edition of the same book, published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:</p>

<p>“Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parliament,
containing reports from British Consuls in Asiatic Turkey, showed
that things were really far worse there than they had been in Bulgaria or
Herzegovina.”</p>

<p>What has followed since 1876 is too well known. For seeking redress
from their frightful grievances the Armenians were hunted like wild beasts
and killed like rats and flies during the Hamidian régime.</p>

<p>You will tell me, my christian friends, that with the rise of the reform
party in Turkey, the era of massacres is at an end, and I will tell you that
the conditions of 1876 and 1896 have not actually changed, though they
may seemingly appear so to the uninformed and uninitiated. I will answer
you that the hideous massacres of April last happened nine months after the
reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. No! my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion.</p>

<p>The massacres in April last raged from Adana to Alexandretta, and
according to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
children were hideously exterminated; more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hideous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetrators of this diabolical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Constantinople
are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the reason they are left unpunished?
because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “true
believers” for killing “Kaffirs.”</p>

<p>The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second, the character of the founder as an example to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four points
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.</p>

<p>“When ye encounter the unbelievers strike off their heads until you
have made a great slaughter of them” is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians?</p>

<p>The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three:
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.</p>

<p>Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book “La Crise de
L’Orient” published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jamais les populations chrétiennes ne se sont révoltées, spontanément,
d’elles-mêmes. Les révoltes ont toujours été partielles et espacées, ce qui
tend bien à prouver qu’elles sont provoquées non par certains injustices
administratives que nous savons être constantes et les mêmes pour tous,
mais par les sourdes menées de l’extérieur. Les agences consulaires, les
écoles étrangères, les maisons des missionnaires, couvertes par les Capitulations,
ont servi de foyer de propagande, de dépôts d’armes, et même de
refuge pour les perturbateurs. Souvent les ambassadeurs sont intervenus
pour faire gracier des rebelles pris et condamnés. On se rappelle avec
quelle solennité les Arméniens qui s’étaient introduits dans la Banque
Ottomane furent conduits sains et saufs à bord d’un bateau par le drogman
de l’Ambassade russe&mdash;leur complice.</p>

<p>“Si ces prétendus patriotards sont tant soutenus et choyés dans le monde
occidental, c’est parce qu’ils constituent un élément ou plutôt un instrument
de destruction au service de certains Européens élevés dans les préjugés des
Croissades et qui crient avec Chateaubriand: (‘L’espèce humaine ne peut
que gagner à la destruction de l’Empire Ottoman’).”</p>

<p>The author of “La Crise de L’Orient” continues in this strain. Are we
then to suppose that the British Consuls, men whose truthfulness has never
been impeached, whose reports on the unsupportable sufferings of the subject
christian races and the oppressions and hideous atrocities of the Turks, have
filled volumes: and likewise the American Missionaries, men who have
deservedly gained the honor and respect of the world, whose statements
have corroborated the British Consular reports; have been according to
Ahmed Riza Bey the mischief-makers in the Turkish Empire? since it is
from them alone the world has gained the widest and most correct knowledge
of the daily miseries and oppressions under which the subject Christian
races have groaned. Are we also to suppose that men like Mr. James
Bryce and Dr. Dillon have by mendacious writings upheld them, British
Consul and American Missionary, liars, and mischief makers? Or
rather are we not to suppose that if thinking men and women in the world
have come to cry out with Chateaubriand “L’espèce humaine ne peut que
gagner à la destruction de l’Empire Ottoman” it is because the Turks have
earned the world’s condemnation through their own diabolical acts, and on
account of the woe and desolation which Turkish rule has worked over the
fairest provinces under the sun. If the Turk will turn from the evil of his
ways unto good, the stigma of “the unspeakable Turk” which now attaches
itself to him, will cease to be a veritable truth. The bringing about of the
transformation rests with himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the Armenian
“prétendus patriotards” in connection with the Ottoman Bank; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: “In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discrepancy
of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conflict in which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolutionary
party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre
was persisted in. These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople,
declaring they were prepared to hold it and blow it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. They captured the building by a <i>coup de main</i>,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragoman to withdraw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Government, who through their spies knew of the
project, had organised and armed a large mob of Kurds and Lazes&mdash;many
of whom had recently been brought to the city&mdash;together with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they launched this mob upon the peaceful
Armenian population. The onslaught began in various parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish ruffians in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt; so that they might less easily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepared in which to carry off the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaughter went on, in which not only
Armenian merchants and traders of the cultivated class, not only the industrious
and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic servants,
porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chargé d’Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the number of killed at from 6000 to 7000; the official report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
made to the Sultan is said to have put it at 8750.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> During the whole time
the army and the police had perfect control of the city&mdash;the police, and a
certain number of the military officers and some high civil officials, joining in
the slaughter. Of all the frightful scenes which Constantinople, a city of
carnage, has seen since the great insurrection of A.D. 527 when 30,000
people perished in the hippodrome there has been none more horrible than
this. For this was not the suppression of an insurrection in which contending
factions fought. It was not the natural sequel to a capture by storm, as
when the city was taken and sacked by the Crusaders in A.D. 1204, and by
the Turks in A.D. 1453. It was slaughter in cold blood, when innocent men
and women, going about their usual avocations in a time of apparent peace,
were suddenly beaten to death with clubs, or hacked to pieces with knives, by
ruffians who fell upon them in the streets before they could fly to any place
of refuge.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I am also obliged to quote from an Article written by a Turkish Officer
who signs himself A. J. and published in the “Siper-i-Saïka-i-Hurriet,” a
Turkish daily, on July 6, 1909.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every time that I hear the name Armenian I feel the bleeding of a moral wound within
me. It was the year I was sent into exile (1896). On a Thursday, before we had left the
Military School for our vacation, a rumor flew through the school,&mdash;“They are massacring
the Armenians.” All my young patriotic companions turned pale from deep emotion. Every
one tried to read in the sad faces of others the reason for this bad news. But each one
avoided expressing his thought. After a time the details began to circulate to the effect that
the Armenians had dared to destroy the Ottoman Bank and government buildings with bombs,
and that this was the reason why they were massacred. At that time all of us trembled,
because we also were enemies of that government, because we also wished to overthrow it, and
although we were not convinced that the best service could be rendered by bombs, we were
working quietly to spread our ideas. In our hearts a flame of enmity and indignation, no less
terrible than bombs, was burning. The poor Armenians were being massacred ruthlessly,
because out of their number five or ten persons, resenting their wrongs, had rebelled. But
that which maddened these poor men, that drove them to rebellion and placed bombs in their
hands was the stupidity of the people and the outrageous oppressions of the government. And
now this inhuman government was killing with clubs a noble nation, under the pretext of
putting down a rebellion produced by its own oppressions. Among the crimes committed by
the former government the most unpardonable crime was the Armenian massacre. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manure carts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.</p>

<p>“This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a cursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”</p>

</div>

<p>This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as “les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as far back as 1907 tries to palliate the horrors of the Hamidian régime by
misrepresentations.</p>

<p>The author of “La Crise de l’Orient” also cites the Japanese as an
instance of the civilization and aptitude for progress of a non-Christian
oriental race. In this case, Ahmed Riza Bey certainly needs to measure the
distance between the mental, moral and humane qualities of the Japanese
and the Turk, a distance as great as lies geographically between the North
Pole and the South.</p>

<h3>THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.</h3>

<p>Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.</p>

<p>In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).</p>

<p>It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL PRINCE LORIS MELIKOFF.</p>

<p class="caption2">Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the impregnable
fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoff; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”</p>

<p>What followed has passed into history. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Israeli) was Premier, and Lord Salisbury
Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Russian
aggrandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real or fancied interests
would thereby become imperilled, England threw in the weight of her power,
and virtually commanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcing the protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of impotent
words given in its stead, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.”</p>

<p>“<i>It will periodically make known the steps taken to this effect to the
Powers, who will superintend their application.</i>” How this last proviso
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.</p>

<p>The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as subsequent
events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.</p>

<p>The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-Turkish
War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
comment in this article. The Czar Liberator stands out in history as that
noble figure&mdash;a benefactor of mankind. Through his humanitarian susceptibilities,
and his sublime efforts for their deliverance, the Christians of
European Turkey received immunity from Turkish slaughter; and the protection
of his benevolent arm was extended over that unhappy Christian
nation of Asiatic Turkey, the Armenians; at least it would have secured
them immunity from the record-breaking slaughter that followed, but the
Power that had stood behind Turkey since 1791 frustrated his endeavours.</p>

<p>A British commentator on that page of British policy has summed it
up in the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In no other part of the world has our national policy or conduct been
determined by motives so immoral and so stupid.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The same commentator, in reviewing also the result of the substituted
Treaty, fittingly remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Turk could see at a glance that, whilst it relieved him of the
dangerous pressure of Russia, it substituted no other pressure which his
own infinite dexterity in delays could not make abortive. As for the unfortunate
Armenians, the change was simply one which must tend to expose
them to the increased enmity of their tyrants, whilst it damaged and discouraged
the only protection which was possible under the inexorable conditions
of the physical geography of the country.”</p>

<p>It had been the constant endeavour of the Patriarch Nerses to point out
to the Armenians that their true policy lay in aiding Russian advance in
Turkey: that even if Russia were selfish in her designs, she was the only
Christian Power that would stand as their protector against Turkish or Persian
tyranny. His political foresight had already been verified as early as
1827,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and his strenuous life-long labours were nearing the goal in 1878, but
were frustrated by the fatal action that intervened.</p>

<p>England, by commanding the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in
place of that of San Stefano had taken upon herself the heaviest obligations
any nation could incur. It is unnecessary to repeat that those obligations
were never fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>If the lamented death of the Emperor Alexander II was one of the most
unhappy events that could have befallen Russia; it was a hundredfold
more unhappy for the Armenian nation. His successor, who adopted repressive
and coercive measures for his own people in the place of his father’s
liberal policy, not only applied the same measures to his Armenian subjects
in his own domains, but left their countrymen under Turkish rule to
their merciless fate.</p>

<p>Russia, twice foiled in her subjugation of Turkey, changed her policy
from that of crushing into that of upholding the Ottoman Empire. When
the horrors of the Armenian massacres, revealed to the people of England
by their own ambassadors and consuls, their own journalists and men of
letters, thrilled the hearts of men and women, when England’s “Grand Old
Man” thundered his vituperations against the “Great Assassin,”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Prince
Lobanoff in answer to British proposals of coercion towards Turkey, conveyed
Russia’s intentions in his warning note to the Salisbury Government,
and England, who in 1878 had rivetted the Turkish yoke on the necks of
the Armenians, to use the words of an eminent British authority on Turkish
affairs, “wrung her hands and submitted.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The same authority tells us that the <i>coup de grace</i> to the intervention
of the Concert of Europe in Armenian affairs was given by Prince Bismarck,
“who in 1883 intimated to the British Government, in terms of cynical
frankness and force, that Germany cared nothing about the matter, and that
it had better be allowed to drop.”</p>

<p>Thus the Concert of Europe, under whose aegis the aspiring Armenians
foolishly and fondly hoped to recover National Autonomy, became the cause
of dealing out to the struggling nation, not security from Turkish oppression,
but instead fire, famine and slaughter, a slaughter to which were added
devilish ingenuity of torture, and the loathsome horrors of Turkish prisons.
If before the Treaty of Berlin the Armenians had suffered from various
phases of Turkish oppression, they had at least not been pursued with the
relentless fury that followed, until the soil of the fatherland was soaked, and
reeked and steamed with the life-blood of its slaughtered sons and daughters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
until women and children were done to their death under the most hideous
and revolting circumstances, and tender youths and cultured men of letters
rotted in Turkish dungeons.</p>

<p>England, with her uneasy conscience, continued spasmodic efforts in the
shape of paper remonstrances, from time to time she rallied the other powers
who were signatories to the Treaty of Berlin and by means of Ambassadorial
Identical Notes and Collective Notes sought to terminate the
horrors that were stirring public feeling at home; but Abdul Hamid, fully
cognizant of the jealousies and rivalries of the Powers, and knowing himself
secure thereby, laughed in his sleeve at all the paper remonstrances.</p>

<p>No action was taken by the Cabinets of Europe to leash the tiger sitting
on the Ottoman throne. The lust of blood and the lust of plunder of “le
Sultan Rouge,” combined with the greed of his satellites, were allowed to
be gratified to the full on a helpless and hapless people, whilst Europe
looked on.</p>

<p>The character of Abdul Hamid has been well summed up in the
testimony of a writer having opportunities of intimate acquaintance with him.</p>

<p>“Il voit dans son peuple un vil troupeau qu’il peut dévorer sans pitié,
et à qui, comme le lion de la Fable, il fait beaucoup d’honneur en daignant
le croquer.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>When to these significant words, we add the following by the same
author:&mdash;</p>

<p>“De ce qu’Abdul Hamid n’est pas bon musulman, il ne faudrait pas
conclure qu’il aime les Chrétiens; il les déteste, au contraire, et emploie
fréquemment le mot <i>giaour</i> pour désigner un infidèle ou insulter un musulman.”</p>

<p>We have the explanation of the Armenian massacres; especially as
that unfortunate people had become by Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin,
subjects of the paper remonstrances of the Powers of Europe, and thereby
also objects of the tyrant’s vengeance.</p>

<p>That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.</p>

<p>Of all sins in this world, perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment, and of all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For their foolishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for European intervention the unfortunate Armenians paid with
rivers of their own blood, and for their crime of failure they were made to
wallow in that blood. The darkest pages of their history have been written
in the closing years of the nineteenth, and the early years of the twentieth
century; never since the loss of their independence, nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so much, and never had they paid so dearly for their folly.</p>

<p>If they had carefully laid to heart the whole history of Europe’s intercourse
with Asia, beginning with the conquests of the Macedonian Alexander,
they would have read in the light of sober judgement, self-interest, and self-interest
only written on every line and page, but they committed the folly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hoping that for their sakes the history of the world, which means in other
words the history of human selfishness, was going to be reversed; and they
forgot what was more important than all, that Europe had nothing to gain
by their emancipation. There is only one explanation for their folly. It is
a peculiarity of human nature that the troubles we have been bearing with
more or less patience, become unbearable when once hopes of deliverance
from them are awakened. Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin awakened
hopes that proved bitterer in the eating than Dead Sea fruit. It aroused
towards the Armenians the diabolical animosity of the human fiend who held
sovereignty over them.</p>

<p>Hunted like wild beasts, killed like rats and flies, out of the depths of
its agony and its martyrdom, the nation has still contrived to rear its head
and live; for it was as it is now, the industrious, energetic, self-respecting
element in the Turkish Empire, with a virile life in its loins and sinews, that
centuries of oppression culminating in the unspeakable horrors of a thirty
years’ martyrdom has failed to exterminate.</p>

<p>As for the Treaty of Berlin&mdash;It has done its work.</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TURKISH CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>The Turkish Constitution came with a bound that shook the equanimity
of Europe. To the anxious and jealously watching eyes of Europe the
“sick man in her midst” was at last becoming moribund. His recovery
was as startling as unexpected. Europe had not correctly gauged the latent
forces within the Turkish Empire, neither had she correctly estimated the
far-reaching astuteness of the tyrant on the throne.</p>

<p>Assailed by enemies from without and within, feeling the foundation of
his throne crumbling, Abdul Hamid, arch murderer and assassin, performed
his own <i>auto da fé</i>, and rose from his ashes a constitutional sovereign. The
obduracy of the merciless tyrant melted like wax before the approach of
personal danger, and the act was necessary to save himself.</p>

<p>Hopes rose high at such a magnificent <i>coup d’état</i> of the revolutionaries.
Young Turks and Armenians fell on each other’s necks, embraced, and
mingled their tears of joy together. Leaders of the Turkish Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
proclaimed in public speeches that the Turks owed the deepest debt of
gratitude to the Armenians who had been the initiators of their struggle for
Freedom, and in the Armenian graveyard at Constantinople Turks held a
memorial service and kissed the graves of the Armenian dead, whom they
called “the martyrs whose blood had been shed for Turkish freedom.”</p>

<p>At the banquet given by Abdul Hamid to the Delegates of the Turkish
Parliament, the Armenian Delegates alone refused to attend, declining to be
the guest of the man responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of
their countrymen.</p>

<p>The Armenian revolutionaries had stood behind the Young Turk party
and joined hands with them; already the nation at large imagined itself
breathing the air of Freedom, and already in anticipation drank in deep
draughts of the air of Liberty.</p>

<p>The awakening came all too quickly. In spite of the Constitution the
machinations of Abdul Hamid and his palace clique could find fruitful ground
among a fanatical populace to whom the Padishah was not only the Lord’s
anointed but the Lord’s appointed, the delegate of the Prophet on whom his
sacred mantle had fallen; added to this the incentive of pecuniary rewards
to a brutal soldiery and the lust of plunder, and once more the horrors of
massacres were let loose on the Armenians. There followed sacked and
burning villages, plundered and devastated homes, an unarmed population
put to the sword, and as in every case, cruelties of the most hideous and
ferocious nature perpetrated on women and children.</p>

<p>In the whole long story of the massacres, courage to face their oppressors
has never been found wanting on the part of the Armenians. It is on
record that the women of a whole mountain village surprised by Turkish
soldiers, in the absence of the men, fought and resisted to the last gasp, and
finally, to escape the clutches of the brutal soldiery, committed suicide with
their children by precipitating themselves from their mountain cliffs. A
nation which could produce such women, and which has had the simple
courage to die for its faith, as no Christian people has died before, is not
wanting in brave men, but no amount of bravery and heroism can save an
unarmed population from being mowed down by soldiery equipped with
modern instruments of carnage and slaughter.</p>

<p>The horrors of Adana coming on the heels of a Constitution they had
aided, and from which they had hoped so much, presages grave fears for the
Armenians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminating
point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish sway, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.</p>

<p>To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the Sheik ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet, before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished.</p>

<p>The Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him?</p>

<p>Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner:
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better the Czar than the Sultan, but better any form of national
autonomy than either Czar or Sultan” has been the principle which has
animated the Armenians, and the goal towards which they have been striving
for thirty years.</p>

<p>National Autonomy has been the dream of the Armenians in Turkey,
but it is well to consider if such a dream has any possibility of realization.
Bulgaria declared her independence, and Austria annexed Bosnia and
Herzegovina, but these reductions of Turkish power were accomplished by
the force that stood behind them. Have the Armenians any such force
which could accomplish their deliverance? Have they an organized army
at their command? Are they equipped with all the necessary weapons of
modern warfare? are questions it is well for the nation to ask before it
makes itself a target for Turkish bullets.</p>

<p>On the other hand is it likely that the Turks will willingly give the
Armenians independence? To do so would mean that they should themselves
dismember their own Empire, and when we see Christian Governments
actuated in their foreign policy by the supremest selfishness; Christian
Governments striving tooth and nail in their own self interest to keep
possessions which are lawfully not their own, then why in the name of
common sense should we expect such extraordinary magnanimity, or such
super-nobility from the Turk.</p>

<p>Armenia stands in the unhappy position of being divided between
Russia and Turkey (if we except Persia, which does not count for much
since 1827). It is evident that even the Czar Liberator, if he had been
allowed to carry out his humanitarian endeavours, would have liberated
Armenia from Turkey, not to give her independence but to make her into a
Russian possession, for to have given Turkish Armenia independence would
have been tantamount to fostering the spirit of independence in those provinces
of Armenia which had already passed under Russian rule.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Emperor Alexander II was guided and influenced
by the liberal principles of Loris Melikoff (or properly Melikian
according to the Armenian termination of his name). Melikian enjoyed the
personal friendship of the Czar, and the successful victor of Kars was
rewarded by his august master with the office of Prime Minister. The policy
of Melikian made for the Russofication of Armenia, and while it is not
possible that he loved Russia more than he loved his own country, it is
rather more than probable that he saw in the Russofication of his nation the
only way of saving its people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>With the death of Alexander II Melikian’s star passed out of the horizon
of Russian ministership; his liberal principles were not acceptable to
Alexander III, and the policy of Russia towards the Armenians underwent a
decided change.</p>

<p>Since the disastrous war with Japan the policy of Russia towards the
Armenians has undergone another change. In the years preceding the war,
the reigning autocrat had pursued the policy of his father to an even greater
degree of repression. Not only had national schools and theatres been
closed in Russian Armenia and newspapers suspended, but the Czar
went still further, and confiscated the lands and the wealth of the Armenian
church.</p>

<p>The late Armenian Catholicos Mukertich Khirimian (one of the delegates
sent to the Congress of Berlin by the Patriarch Nerses), to whom his own
people had given the beloved appellation of “Hairik” (little father) had by
his noble life of self-sacrifice, his unceasing labours for the cause of the
people, and his remarkable individuality, come to be regarded as a sort of
holy man. There in the Cathedral of Etchmiatzin, under the venerable dome
where for seventeen hundred years the successors of Gregore Loosavoritch
(Gregory the Illuminator) had each in his turn held sway, and worshipped
on the spot where the vision of Christ the Lord had descended, there before
the altar of Christ, had Hairik the holy man lifted up his voice and cursed&mdash;cursed
the Czar; and cursed Russia&mdash;Pious Russia with its pious Czar at its
head shuddered, and the astounding reverses in the war with Japan that
followed were attributed to Khirimian’s curse.</p>

<p>Russia in Expiation made Reparation: the ban on schools, theatres and
newspapers was removed, the church lands and the church wealth were
restored, and the Czar of all the Russias in a friendly note to the Armenian
Catholicos assured him of the Imperial friendship, and the Imperial solicitude
for the welfare of his people.</p>

<p>The return from exile of the Patriarch Ezmerlian to Constantinople, was
quickly followed by his nomination to the See of Etchmiatzin, left vacant by
the death of his predecessor, and now we hear of the Catholicos appealing
to the Russian Government to take over the protectorate of Armenia from
Turkey. Ezmerlian knows Turkey, he has been in close touch with the
liberal Turks, and he knows the Turkish nation as a whole; he knows also
that the present and immediate future of Russia is dark in the gloom of
autocratic Czardom, and a man of his intellectual attainments and liberal
principles can have no sympathy with absolutism. The appeal therefore of
the Catholicos Ezmerlian (the Iron Patriarch as he is familiarly known) must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
be read as a premonition, that not only has all hope of wresting national
autonomy from Turkey died in his resolute heart, but also that he entertains
grave fears of the possibility of the horrors of Adana being repeated.</p>

<p>Russia may go on massacring Jews until Russians have left off being
fanatical devils, and learned to be human, but however much she may pursue
the policy of suppressing nationalism, however much she may seek to absorb
the nation into herself, she has stopped at slaughter as far as Armenians are
concerned. In his appeal to Russia, the Catholicos can be actuated by no
other motive except the one motive of safe-guarding the people, of whom he
is the acknowledged head.</p>

<p>A man of high character and a dauntless
patriot, known to his people under the
beloved appellation of “Hairik” (little
father). He was one of the delegates
sent by the Patriarch Nerses to the
Congress of Berlin in 1878. He worked
for the cause of the people during his
whole life, and died, worn out with heartbreaking
disappointments; his dying
words were, “We must not despair.”</p>

<p>In an article entitled “The Church of
Ararat” by Henry W. Nevinson in
Harper’s Monthly Magazine of April,
1908 there is given the following interesting
account of the late Catholicos.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The old man was sitting up in bed, a gray
rug neatly spread over him for counterpane.
There was something childlike and appealing in
his position, as there always is about a sick man
lying in bed in the daytime. One felt a little
brutal standing beside him, dressed, and well, and
tingling from the cold outside. It was a time for
soothing hands and motherly care to put this baby of fourscore years to rest. But his mother
was long ago forgotten: even his wife had been dead for half a century; and his only nurse
was a stalwart black-bearded bishop of middle age.</p>

<p>It was a long, low room, pleasant in its austerity. The whitewashed walls, the bare floor,
the absence of all ornament, told of a clean and devoted mind. The windows looked upon a
courtyard, silent but for the murmur and fluttering of pigeons. The old man’s hands lay
quiet on the blanket, white, and wasted almost to the bone. The nightgown hid a form so
thin it hardly made a ripple under the clothes. Through the white and shrunken face every
lineament of the future skull was already visible; but on each side of the thin nose, hooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal unquenched.
On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.</p>

<p>Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men&mdash;Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people&mdash;slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or “The Only-Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formidable
Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom&mdash;a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim&mdash;the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failed.</p>

<p>From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppression in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality&mdash;such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.</p>

<p>But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of “Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.</p>

<p>So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the “great assassin.” It
was the lowest point of Europe’s shame.</p>

<p>Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the value of £6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the overwhelming
defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia’s policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.</p>

<p>Such was the past upon which the worn old man, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter’s morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. He no longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.</p>

<p>Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their chief, still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appointment
of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of “The Bell” and “The Flag.” Of these,
the Social Democratic “Bell” follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the political future of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ani has stood a splendid but
empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagöz, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Persians,
Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinctly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that true patriotism ever survives.</p>

<h3>THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diabolical, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequately
describe their horrors.</p>

<p>Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th edition of his book “Transcaucasia and Ararat” makes the following
grave comment:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Twenty years is a short space in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have been filled with sufferings for the Armenian Christians
greater than their ancestors had to endure during the eight centuries that
have passed since the first Turkish Conquest of Armenia. They have been
years of misery, slaughter, martyrdom, agony, despair.”</p>

<p>And the years that have followed from 1896 to 1909 have had the
same tale of woe to unfold; a tale of horrors such as have never been surpassed
in the history of nations.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Turkish Pasha, “The way to get rid of the Armenian
Question, is to get rid of the Armenians” was followed by “le Sultan Rouge,”
and that the monster and assassin who sat on the Turkish throne from 1876
to 1909 was not able to accomplish this policy to the bitter end of complete
extermination, was no doubt due to the grit and stubborn endurance of the
victims.</p>

<p>A Turkish writer has made the remark, “There are Armenians, but
there is no Armenia.” This assertion would be true if meant in a political
sense only, for of all civilized races on earth, Armenians are politically one
of the most forlorn, but the country has not been wiped off the map. It still
occupies the geographical place it has held since history has been written.
The land of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Araxes valley, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief, God made
man in His own image, and the country round the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the earth.</p>

<p>Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geographical
position of the country became the cause of its people’s ruin.</p>

<p>It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, meet, whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
children of the land of Ararat have passed under the sovereignties of Czar,
Sultan and Shah. Thus it may be true that there is no Armenia in the
political sense of the word, but if Armenia has lost her independence, the
Armenian people have survived.</p>

<p>The Author of “Transcaucasia and Ararat” thus writes of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Armenians are an extraordinary people, with a tenacity of
national life scarcely inferior to that of the Jews.”</p>

<p>The remark is true. There are two nations of antiquity who notwithstanding
unremitting persecutions, and centuries of loss of independence,
have survived their contemporary nations; their fortunes have run on
parallel lines, though their national characteristics have been different in some
respects. Together with his other avocations, the Armenian is mountaineer,
soldier, labourer, agriculturist, while the Jew is purely a dweller in cities; but
the same virility of life, the same mental and physical strength have sustained
both. The sons of Heber, great grandson of Shem, have however become
wise in their generation, the Jew is now more American than the American,
more British than the British, more French than the French, more German
than the German. Not so the sons of Haik, great grandson of Japhet, for
with the same determined obstinacy with which he has clung to his faith, the
Armenian clings to his nationality. He has known how to resist Russian
endeavours of absorption, and Turkish systems of extermination. When he
gives up his nationality, it will be the story of the hunted animal brought to
its last gasp.</p>

<p>The Armenians have been called “the most determined of Christians,”
a remark the truth of which has been borne out by their unequalled
martyrdom for their faith; and yet it may truly be said that in no Christian
Church is the lay element more strong than it is in the Armenian Church.
Conscious of this freedom, Armenians are surprised to read assertions made
by some writers, about “the gross superstitions” of their Church, which
they on their part regard as the happy medium between Protestantism and
Roman Catholicism. Surrounded with pomp and splendour, and a show of
outward ceremonies, which the average Armenian regards as no more than
mere adjuncts to gratify and impress the sensibilities, the Liturgy of the
Armenian Church, in its grandeur and pathos, appeals to the heart of the
Armenian people, as no other form of worship can; it is the reason, as has
truly been said of them, that “they carry their religion with them wherever
they go.”</p>

<p>The Armenians have also been called “the interpreters between the
East and the West.” There is no doubt a certain adaptability which is a
national characteristic; and as language is the vehicle of comprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
their talent for acquiring languages helps to bring them into touch with
Eastern and Western peoples; but the main truth of the observation lies in
the fact, that being born Asiatics, and living for the most part in the midst of
Asiatic surroundings, they fall into the ways of Asiatic life; they understand
Asiatics better, and know how to sympathise with them; whilst on the other
hand, their religion is the religion which has moulded the thought of the
West, and consequently also the religion that has moulded the thought of
a people who were the earliest Christians.</p>

<p>The main point of social difference between them and other Asiatic
nations, lies in the exalted position occupied by their women, and this point
of difference may be traced to that one cause or influence, which has exalted
the position of women in the West, the doctrines of Jesus of Nazareth.
This point of difference in social life, together with the difference of religion,
has always kept them separate from Persian and Turk.</p>

<p>Private and trustworthy information to hand brings the news that the
ex Sultan Abdul Hamid, aware of his impending dethronement, desired to
bring about a general massacre of Christians in Constantinople, beginning
with the foreign Embassies downwards. “I must be the last Padishah, even
though Turkey perish,” was Abdul’s frantic appeal to his satellites, but his
minions, not daring to venture on so dangerous an undertaking, planned the
massacres to begin at the village of Adana, inhabited by the unfortunate
Armenians. It was a safe plan, since the Armenians had no battleships to
turn their guns upon Constantinople, and by the bombardment of the capital,
to seek revenge for the murder of their countrymen.</p>

<p>A massacre so wanton as that of Adana, can only find its counterpart
in the other Turkish massacres of Armenians which preceded it.</p>

<p>“Abdul the Damned” has been dethroned, but he has not been
executed, and so long as he continues to draw breath, as long is there danger
for the Armenians.</p>

<p>We hear of the Mahommedans in India cabling their petition to the new
Turkish Government to spare the life of the ex-Padishah and the ex-Caliph of
Islam; the erstwhile “God’s shadow on earth” and the erstwhile “God’s
envoy on earth” the sacredness of whose person should be inviolate. In
this demonstration of the Indian Mahommedans, we can read the epistle of
Mahommedan thought, and feel the pulse of Mahommedan feeling all over
the Sunni Moslem world.</p>

<p>Although intensely mercenary, Abdul Hamid however not only never
grudged the gold which helped to accomplish the Armenian massacres, but
he used it largely in douceurs which purchased silence or false representations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of his diabolical acts, and it was by means of such douceurs that he
went farther than seducing merely his own subjects.</p>

<p>“Mais l’oeuvre de l’impérial corrupteur a dépassé les limites de son
Palais et de ses États, N’a-t-il pas, en effet, étouffé sous des baillons dorés
la voix d’importants organes de la presse européenne? N’a-t-il pas acheté à
l’étranger des politiciens et même des diplomates?</p>

<p>“Saïd Pacha ayant recherché ce qu’en six mois les massacres d’Arménie
avaient coûté au Trésor turc, en allocations à certains journaux européens, a
établi le compte approximatif suivant: 640 décorations, et 235,000 Livres
Turques (près de cinq millions et demi)!”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It needs not be added that no one who knows the truth of Turkish affairs,
doubts the truth of this impeachment.</p>

<p>“But whatever the future may bring, the past is past, and will one day
fall to be judged. And of the judgement of posterity there can be little
doubt.”</p>

<p>In these memorable words, Mr. James Bryce in the supplementary
chapter of his book “Transcaucasia and Ararat” concludes his criticism on
what he calls “the fatal action followed by the fatal inaction of the European
Powers.”</p>

<p>It is true. As surely as the world revolves on her own axis, and as
day succeeds night, so surely History will record and Posterity will judge.
But what compensation to the Armenians? What compensation for the
rivers of blood that have inundated their land? What atonement for the
hideous past? What relief for the present? What hope for the future?</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE FUTURE
OF THE ARMENIANS.</h3>

<p>The above is a subject for profound meditation for the Armenian
people; it has therefore naturally for me occupied much deep thought.</p>

<p>National Autonomy has been the dream of the Armenians; a dream
which through centuries of oppression and years of slaughter, the nation has
been striving and struggling to realize. The oldest of historical nations, we
have held to our nationality, language and religion; we have struggled and
striven, and though billows of affliction have swept over us, we have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
allowed ourselves to be engulfed. “Love is stronger than Death” and
truly the Armenian has loved his nationality with a steadfastness and tenacity
that has conquered death.</p>

<p>Steady, stubborn grit, combined with a remarkable natural intelligence
have been characteristics of the race, and have kept us alive in spite of
national adversities, such as no other nation could have suffered and
survived.</p>

<p>But our position is an acutely unhappy and an acutely unfortunate one.
Our misfortunes began with the physical geography of our country. Surrounded
by three great empires, our kingdom was strangled by the overwhelming
pressure, and to-day our country is divided up between Russia,
Turkey and Persia. For this reason we have been a great deal more
unfortunate than the Balkan States, and now if there were any possible
chance of wresting autonomy for Turkish Armenia from Turkey, Russia
fearing the spread of the same spirit in her own provinces, would assuredly
not only frown on such an attempt but use all the means in her power to
crush it.</p>

<p>There is also a stern fact which a people so politically helpless and
forlorn as ourselves must ever bear in mind, namely, that we live in an
intensely selfish and intensely grasping world; no prating the pretty
nonsense of Western Civilization, or Western Humanity, or Western
Christianity can alter that stern hard fact as it stands, and as it has stood
since the history of our world has been written.</p>

<p>Indeed, nineteenth century civilization, which has made the world of
commerce acutely grasping, has also made the world of Politics unscrupulously
selfish.</p>

<p>However much it may clothe itself in the garment of fair speech,
what we call “Politics” is actually made up of that one devouring, absorbing,
grasping element&mdash;Selfishness. “The friends of to-day may be
enemies to-morrow” is more truly spoken in the domain of Politics than
anywhere else.</p>

<p>Let the Armenians take a lesson not only from the Turkish massacres,
but from the attitude of Europe towards those massacres? Let them look
back on the past, and remember how they have been trampled under the
merciless foot of Political Selfishness, and then left to welter in their gore.</p>

<p>Who doubts, who can gainsay, that by so much as the lifting up of a
finger the Powers of Europe could have stopped those massacres? Was
that finger ever lifted up, however, all through the long years of “slaughter,
martyrdom, agony, despair” to save our helpless people from butcheries so
enormous, so hideous, so appalling that no pen could portray the horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
realities? Had the Turkish bonds been in jeopardy, Constantinople harbour
would have witnessed the battleships of the Powers of Europe discharging their
cannon on the capital of the Turkish Empire, but a hundred thousand or five
hundred thousand Armenians, more or less, mangled and butchered to death, or
fleeing from their sacked and burning villages to die of cold and starvation in
their mountain passes, could not rouse action on the part of Europe, even
though the Concert of Europe had been instrumental in their destruction.</p>

<p>I do not write with a desire to indulge in recriminations, since vain
recriminations will not bear profitable fruit; but I write with the object of
impressing on my countrymen to remember, always to remember, the lessons
written on the pages of a past that should never be forgotten by us.</p>

<p>In his book “Our Responsibilities for Turkey” the late Duke of Argyll
quotes from the famous despatch of a British Ambassador to Turkey, the
date being given as September 4, 1876. The despatch proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the accusation of being a blind partisan of the Turks I will only
answer that my conduct here has never been guided by any sentimental
affection for them, but by a firm determination to uphold the interests of
Great Britain to the utmost of my power; and that those interests are deeply
engaged in preventing the disruption of the Turkish Empire is a conviction
which I share in common with the most eminent statesmen who have directed
our foreign policy, but which appears now to be abandoned by shallow
politicians or persons who have allowed their feelings of revolted humanity
to make them forget the capital interests involved in the question.</p>

<p>“We may and must feel indignant at the needless and monstrous
severity with which the Bulgarian insurrection was put down; <i>but the
necessity which exists for England to prevent changes from occurring here
which would be most detrimental to ourselves is not affected by the question
whether it was 10,000 or 20,000 persons who perished in the suppression</i>.</p>

<p>“We have been upholding what we know to be a semi-civilized nation,
liable under certain circumstances to be carried into fearful excesses; but the
fact of this having just now been strikingly brought home to us all cannot be
a sufficient reason for abandoning a policy which is the only one that can be
followed with due regard to our interest.”</p>

<p>I quote this famous despatch merely to point out that “due regard to
our interest” was carefully followed out in the Past by the Powers of Europe,
and that “due regard to our interest” will be just as carefully followed out in
the Present and in the Future.</p>

<p>From the Turk and Persian, the Armenian must ever remain separate,
as he has through centuries, though living in the midst of them,
remained separate. The gulf that divides the one nation from the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith. For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edged sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.</p>

<p>If “East is East, and West is West” it is on account of the social plane
on which woman stands, a social plane that is never so degraded in any
corner of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahommed governs.</p>

<p>The Armenians in Asiatic Turkey are scattered and dispersed among
Turks and other antagonistic races; they are without any military force or
organization to wrest autonomy from the military and governing power.
That Europe should aid their endeavours, or that Turkey should make them
a free gift of autonomy, are both of them absolutely out of the question.
Then what remains for us?</p>

<p>To hold to our own nationality and to be subject&mdash;Subject to Russia,
subject to Turkey, subject to Persia&mdash;What shall it profit us? What will
it profit? What doth it profit us? Our strong, clever, energetic men, our
beautiful, intelligent women, when neither chance nor opportunity can enable
our finest and best to reach the higher rungs of the world’s ladder, and
when as a subject people we must ever remain hewers of wood and drawers
of water, even our Aivasowskis and our Melikoffs have been known to the
world as Russians, not as Armenians. Have we a chance of bursting the
fetters? Have we strength to break the chains? Can we reach the goal
toward which, bleeding and torn, we have been striving, and still are striving?
These are questions which we must ask ourselves; looking them soberly in
the face.</p>

<p>But this is not enough: if we must persist in holding to our nationality,
we must look into ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings and our national weaknesses, and find out in what essential characteristics
we are wanting as a nation, and so build up national character. Let
us weigh ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.</p>

<p>In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient. The people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successfully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-handed
to engage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia’s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo-Japanese War. “Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”</p>

<p>These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an example which the world needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.</p>

<p>From the astounding success of Japan let us turn to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed on American soil not quite three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>National Unity is our greatest need; it is the banner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japanese
lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.</p>

<p>We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.</p>

<p>Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What shall it profit a man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.</p>

<h3>THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND CIVILIZED
EUROPE.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Hear then ye Senates! hear this truth sublime,</div>
<div class="verse">They who allow Oppression share the crime.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the twentieth century of the christian era, in the age of trumpeted
progress, of boasted and vaunted civilization, there is a Ramah of countries,
a desolated Ramah, blackened and calcined with the fires of oppression, and
over her desolated wastes there flows, flows, continually flows, ever replenished
and ever renewed, that red stream which crieth up from the earth
to God: and out of this modern Ramah, a voice is heard of lamentation and
bitter weeping, it riseth up in its boundless anguish to reach the heavens, it
crieth out and will not be stopped, for it is the voice of the Rahel of nations
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.</p>

<p>Ah! thou Rahel of nations! to the cry of thy boundless anguish, to thy
lamentation and bitter weeping, Christendom and Civilization, the Christendom
and Civilization of Europe have replied “Are we thy children’s
keepers?”</p>

<p>Who that has read the history of the Crusades has not turned with
sickening disgust from the chapters wherein history has recorded the savage
barbarities and fearful excesses of those christian warriors, who went to
Palestine ostensibly fired with the enthusiasm of a holy cause, but in reality
only to glut in slaughter and gratify brutal passions. Europe has, however,
designated her past as the “dark ages” into which she has thrust back, the
ferocious outbursts of religion, the merciless persecutions of the church, the
savage sweep of the barbarians of the north, and the unbridled tyrannies of
despotic power, from all which she loudly boasts to have emancipated herself,
and like the evolution according to the Darwinian theory of the anthropomorphal
ape, to have progressed into the state of civilization. But
beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and on into the first decade
of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest ages in human history
have lain at her doors, and towards these horrors Europe has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking, sweetly frowning,
smilingly denouncing, Disapprover.</p>

<p>Half a million Armenians annihilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
fated either to rot to death in Turkish prisons or made homeless and
destitute to die of cold and starvation, with Europe nonchalantly looking on
is surely convincing proof that the Humanity, Christianity and Civilization of
Europe are whited sepulchres, hiding by the smooth outside the rottenness
within; therefore ye priests of the gospel come down from your pulpits, close
your churches, hold your tongues and be silent for ever, for the Christianity
you preach has bowed itself out, if ever it existed, in Christian Europe.
The Christ of Europe is the demon of greed and the demon of land hunger,
and the god of civilization is Mammon.</p>

<p>In 1878 an astounding policy was carried out by Great Britain; it was
the crowning act of her long continued support to Turkey, a government
she knew to be hopelessly vicious and profoundly cruel and bad to the core.
With this Power, England posing before the world as the home of freedom,
the friend of the oppressed, and the defender of the rights and liberties of
man, entered into a Convention. It was called the “Anglo-Turkish Convention,”
of which Article I reads thus:</p>

<p>“If Batum, Ardahan, Kars, or any of them, shall be retained by Russia,
and if any attempt shall be made at any future time by Russia to take possession
of any further territories of his Imperial Majesty the Sultan in Asia,
as fixed by the definitive Treaty of Peace, England engages to join his
Imperial Majesty the Sultan in defending them by force of arms. In return
his Imperial Majesty the Sultan promises to England to introduce necessary
reforms, to be agreed upon later between the two Powers, into the government
and for the protection of the Christian and other subjects of the Porte
in these territories. And in order to enable England to make necessary
provision for executing her engagement, his Imperial Majesty the Sultan
further consents to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered
by England.”</p>

<p>It is well to remark here what was blazoned to the world at the time that
part of those “<i>necessary reforms</i>” “<i>in these territories</i>” include twenty-two
large organized massacres of Armenians (besides smaller ones) dating from
September 30th, 1895 to December 29th, 1895; and be it remembered that
these were massacres of a hideousness and ferocity of nature even devils could
not rival; besides also other organized massacres by the Turkish Government
of the same nature (large and small) both before and after that period.</p>

<p>The British press, followed by a large section of the British public,
raged against what they called the advance of Russia in the East, as they
had already raged for half a century past. It is astonishing how one nation
can swallow its own camels and strain at the other’s gnats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>However, this Anglo-Turkish Convention and the Congress at Berlin
was the crowning act of England’s support and defense of a power whose
rule had been characterized by mis-rule, massacre and oppression. Her
prime minister returned from the Congress of Berlin loudly proclaiming
“Peace with Honour.” Of that “Honour” Time has been the test, and
Time has revealed to the world that “Peace” in its true character.</p>

<p>Dating from the Congress of Berlin the supreme tragedy of Armenia
begins; deliberately and without compunction England revived the dying
tyranny of Turkey for the Armenians, deliberately and without compunction
she took away from them (a people politically the most helpless and forlorn
of all civilized nations) the only protection they had of a powerful neighbour
willing and able to enforce its protection, and rivetted on their necks the
yoke of the cruellest oppressor that the world had yet known. The history
of the rule of the house of Osman up to the thirty-fourth Padishah was knowledge
enough and experience enough for the British Government and the
British people, and yet in the last quarter of the civilized nineteenth century,
the great and enlightened Christian power of Great Britain proceeded to
carry out and complete this gigantic political crime of fastening on the necks
of a struggling Christian people, the last remnants of an ancient civilization,
the merciless yoke of their oppressors. From that time onward history
must mark the course of the supreme tragedy of Armenia.</p>

<p>The bold move taken by the Patriarch Nerses of sending delegates to
the Congress of Berlin cost the renowned prelate his life, his firm refusal to
recall his delegates aroused the last fury of Turkey’s Padishah; the Patriarch
was stealthily murdered and his genius and great personal influence lost to
the cause of his people.</p>

<p>But a loss greater than the loss of their beloved leader befell the
Armenians in the assassination of the Emperor Alexander II, whose untimely
death plunged Russia back into the night of ignorance, bigotry and superstition,
of the savagery and slavery, out of the darkness of which he was leading
her; the best and noblest of Czars was succeeded by a son whose policy
shaped itself directly contrary to that of his father’s, and Russia from being
the help of the Armenians under Turkish rule turned into one of the pillars
of support of their oppressor.</p>

<p>“Since 1884,” writes Mr. James Bryce, “it has been generally understood
in Constantinople that the Russian Embassy has made no serious
effort to bring about any radical change in Turkish administration, and it was
indeed believed that the more England remonstrated the more did Russia
point out to the Sultan how much he had erred in supposing that England
was his friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>We have it on the authority of Professor Arminius Vambéry that the
Czar Alexander III had given assurances of his friendship and support to
Sultan Abdul Hamid; and there are not wanting political students who affirm
that the Armenian Massacres were in part instigated by Russian politicians
who saw, or professed to see, in a free Armenia an impediment to Russia’s
advance in the south and a fostering of the spirit of independence in the
Russian provinces of Armenia.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This on the authority of Mr. James Bryce
was the reason which Prince Lobanoff assigned for his refusal to give
support to British proposals of coercion towards Turkey. “On January
16, 1896,” so writes Mr. Bryce, “when the massacres had gone on for
more than three months, he (Prince Lobanoff) ‘saw nothing to destroy his
confidence in the bonne volonté of the Sultan, who was’ (”he felt assured“)
‘doing his best.’” And Mr. Bryce continues to add “Turkey, which in
1877 had looked to England for help against Russia, now turned to Russia
for support against the menaces of England.”</p>

<p>We have it also on the authority of Mr. Bryce that shortly after the
terrible and cold-blooded massacre of Armenians at Constantinople “the
German Ambassador presented to the Sultan a picture of the German Imperial
family which he had asked for some time ago”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the friendship of Kaiser
Wilhelm for Abdul Hamid “his friend and brother,” as an American writer
has called him; the costly gifts presented by the ex-Sultan to the German
Imperial family, the magnificent reception of the Kaiser at Constantinople,
and the still more magnificent concession of Turkish territory to Germany,
are too well known to the world to need any further comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it became the fate of the unfortunate Armenians to be the bruised
and mangled shuttle-cock of powerful bats.</p>

<p>Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,
(far more comprehensively and by pens much more forcible than my humble
efforts could aspire to reach) against the selfishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those great powers which have coldly looked on
and permitted the hellish atrocities and horrors of the Armenian Massacres.
The name of William Ewart Gladstone is loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of those thoughtful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themselves heard in sounding language, have fallen on
stony ground; they have been like the voices of men crying out in the wilderness.
Europe has turned a deaf ear to the condemnations of justice and
truth, even as she has turned a deaf ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for
her slaughtered children.</p>

<p>The victim of Abdul Hamid’s
revenge who was stealthily murdered
in his bed. He was elected Patriarch
in 1843 and held the highest place in
the esteem and affection of his people.
Mr. James Bryce gives his age at the
time of his election in 1843 as
seventy-three; if this is correct then
he was over a hundred years old
when he was foully murdered. Mr.
Bryce writes of him as, “the worthy
leader of his nation,” “a man of
high character and great ability.”</p>

<p>A writer signing himself Beyzadé
gives the following account of the
Patriarch’s tragic death in the July
number of “The Wide World:”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The attempted poisoning and subsequent
death of Monseigneur Nercès Varjabétian,
the Armenian Patriarch and Archbishop of
Constantinople, was a revolting illustration
of the inhuman and barbarous tactics of the
Yildiz Kiosk “Camarilla.” Monseigneur
Nercès Varjabétian was not only one of the
most prominent prelates of the Armenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Church, but was also a fearless patriot&mdash;a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.</p>

<p>At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden Horn. The success of the delegation,
however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.</p>

<p>The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriarch this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Archbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha’s
house. The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.</p>

<p>After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusual for guests to bring their
own <i>tchooboukdar</i> (the servant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a “tchoobouk” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted both
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, “Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!”</p>

<p>This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scuffle was going on behind
the <i>portière</i>, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan’s whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public&mdash;the
poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
took his breakfast upstairs he found, to his horror, that both the bedroom door and the
window were wide open and his beloved master lay dead in his bed, which was covered with
blood! There are no such things as coroners and juries in Turkey to ascertain the causes of
mysterious deaths of this kind, but the news that the Patriarch was dead spread like wildfire
through Constantinople. The Sultan himself thought it advisable to show some concern in
the matter, and aides-de-camp from the Palace were sent to the Patriarchate to learn the full
details of this “sad catastrophe,” as they termed it. The official statement was that the
Archbishop died of dysentery. Only a very few know how the Archbishop had died, and
they wisely kept their mouths shut.</p>

<p>I was told the details of this story by a high official of the Armenian Patriarchate. It
seems that as the poison did not act as quickly as the Patriarch’s enemies had anticipated,
owing to his having been cautioned in the nick of time, they “had to resort to other means”!
The funeral was the largest ever witnessed in Constantinople, with an escort of Turkish
cavalry sent specially by the Sultan, and representatives of all the religious denominations
and the Diplomatic Corps. I was myself present, representing a foreign Government.</p>

<p>“Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”</p>

</div>

<p>A book has been written and published in Japan, its title “Niku Dan”
translated into English, reads, “Human Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known of languages; and its young author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the most terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Field
Marshal’s appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General’s
commendation.</p>

<p>In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entanglements,
and exploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.</p>

in saddest words.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And mine is boundless woe,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the grim warrior’s heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In the world’s greatest war, human bullets were sacrificed for the
protection of hearths and homes and a nation’s existence, moreover the
human bullets were made of men who fought and died for sovereign and
country.</p>

<p>But there is a counter picture of horrors in which also there has been a
sacrifice of human bullets, made not only of men but of women and children,
human bullets, not of soldiers, themselves fortified and equipped with
instruments of slaughter for fighting and grappling with the foe, but human
bullets of unarmed men, of helpless women and children, of youth and old
age, caught like rats in a rat-trap; and these human bullets have been
sacrificed to the savage lusts of murder and plunder of the world’s fiercest
oppressors, and to the political and commercial interests of civilized nations.</p>

<p>In the first decade of the civilized twentieth century, a horrible and
wanton slaughter of unarmed men, of helpless women and children has been
perpetrated with all the accessories of cruelties unsurpassed for their
fiendishness: whole towns and villages have been desolated, homes pillaged
and destroyed, not only men, but women and children subjected to hideous
deaths and nameless horrors, which no pen could depict in their true realism,
and the details could never go into print, and this wanton slaughter, even as
the many of a similar nature that have preceded it, has come and gone like
a ripple on a smooth sea.</p>

<p>No cry of horror has risen from the hearts of civilized nations! Turkey
can butcher the helpless victims of her greed and carnivorous instincts with
impunity, since Christendom and Civilization are busy only with Turkish
concessions, with land grabbing and money making.</p>

<p>“Human Bullets”! “Human Bullets”! here are human bullets of
heavier rain than at the world’s grimmest siege; here are “sure death
detachments” hurled to a more pitiful fate; and the civilized world does not
care, for Armenian Massacres come and go, and the civilized world is getting
used to them. But in the eternal order of things, a Nemesis follows human
actions, be they of individuals or of nations. Material Prosperity is a great
and good thing, but Moral Prosperity is greater and better. The Armenians
may be done to their death, the last remnants of an ancient civilization may
be exterminated and consigned in their blood to oblivion; but to the nations
grown great in material prosperity that for their own selfish interests can
allow and condone this hellish extermination, history teaches a mighty
lesson. The moral cancer eating into the moral sense of nations, saps
moral prosperity which in its turn undermines material prosperity. Great
Empires once flourishing have decayed through moral poverty. History
repeats itself.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE TURKISH CONSTITUTION MEANS
FOR THE ARMENIANS.</h3>

<p>A year has passed since the inauguration of the Turkish Constitution;
since the first glad cries of “liberty, fraternity, equality” were resounded as
heralds of the peace and prosperity that were to follow; but although a
whole year has passed, the Turkish Constitution, thus far, has only paraded
itself as a spectacular effect, and as a panorama on shifting sand.</p>

<p>A whole year has passed and the liberal Turks have produced neither
a Prince Ito nor an Abraham Lincoln, though both were urgently needed to
meet the pressing exigencies and heavy responsibilities of the times; and we
may well ask now, Where is the man who is to hold the helm of the Constitutional
ship and steer it over the turbulent waters?</p>

<p>The task of the new régime was the most difficult that could have
fallen to any administration. Beset on the one hand by the jealousies,
rivalries, and political intrigues of European Powers; on the other, by the
machinations of that “Red Beast” the ex-Sultan and his murderous and
corrupt clique, by disappointed plundering pashas and officials (compelled
to grant their arch enemy the ex-Sultan a lease of life through fear of a
fanatical populace), the liberal Turks on their own part have not brought to
bear upon their work any administrative ability, when extraordinary powers
of governing and the highest and strongest genius for administration were
absolutely needed. The Turk has always shown to the world that he is a
born fighter, but a puerile administrator.</p>

<p>For the Armenians the Constitution has resulted in two conditions&mdash;Massacre
and Oppression; their hopes and aspirations have ended in the
death throes of, as some accounts give, thirty thousand and others fifty
thousand of their unhappy race, in homelessness and precipitation into
absolute destitution of a few more thousands,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and in insecurity for the nation
at large. An unarmed population scattered and dispersed among a hostile,
murderous and fanatical populace; their position even under the new régime
is to be compared to that of herbivorous animals standing at bay in the
midst of ravening wolves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>His spiritual interests call upon the Moslem Turk and the Moslem Kurd
to murder the Christian Armenian; his material interests to plunder and
enrich his own idleness with the worldly goods the other has acquired by his
industry and toil, and the prosperity and well-being that the Armenian
labours to bring to the fairest provinces under the sun are swooped upon
and devastated by the brigandage of his enemies. Religious fanaticism and
lust of plunder have always been governing elements in the Turkish massacres,
and against these same religious fanaticism and lust of plunder, the
Armenians stand to-day in deadly peril under the new régime.</p>

<p>What more is to follow? Our hearts sicken to forecast, and our
minds tremble to foresee. Are the balance of our striplings and our greybeards,
our pen-men, and our ploughmen to be made to rot in Turkish
dungeons, condemned to such loathsome horrors as can only be perpetrated
in Turkish prisons? Are the balance of our women to be subjected to
agonies so hideous and revolting that death at the fiery stake or on the iron
rack were mercy and bliss? Are the balance of our babes and children to
be exterminated like vermin? Are the balance of our people, the industrious,
intelligent, clean, self-respecting element in the Turkish Empire,
to be yet again hunted like wild beasts and killed like rats and flies?</p>

<p>We are not wild and lawless descendants of Jenghis Khan and
Tamerlane: we are peace-loving, law-abiding citizens, lovers of language and
literature, of the arts and sciences, energetic traders, hardworking tillers of
the soil, industrious artizans and labourers, producing in ourselves all the
elements that constitute the society and well-being of civilized man; and as
the oldest Christians, we ask of Christian nations, if we are to be trodden
out?</p>

<p>On the soil of our fatherland we are surrounded by a murderous,
marauding, religion-frenzied populace, and neither Humanity nor Christianity
will hold out to us a helping hand.</p>

<p>If nothing else were done for the Armenians, at least Christian governors
should be appointed over the provinces inhabited by them: we do not
expect the Turkish Government to do this of their own initiative, but we have
a right to expect the European Powers that were signatories to the Treaty of
Berlin to compel the new régime to do it. Since the signing of the famous
Treaty of Berlin thirty-one years ago, the history of the Armenians has been
written in blood and tears, as the history of no other nation has been written
before or now; and we ask, How long? How long will the Christian
Powers stand silent witnesses to the work of slaughter and oppression carried
on under their eyes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! the weight of the Turkish bonds is too heavy in the scale, and
Armenian life too light; the selfish interests of the European Powers involved
in the Turkish Empire cannot be endangered to save the blood of three or
four millions of Armenians, and the death warrant of an oppressed and bleeding
nation can find no place on the table of the Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization.</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE ARMENIAN QUESTION.</h3>

<p>In the closing pages of “Twenty Years of the Armenian Question”
published in 1896, its distinguished author,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> one of the greatest authorities
on the subject, makes the following notable comment on the character and
fate of the Armenian race.</p>

<p>“They had maintained their nationality from immemorial times, before
history began to be written. They had clung to their Christian faith, under
incessant persecution for fifteen centuries. They were an intelligent, laborious
race, full of energy, and increasing in numbers wherever oppression and
murder did not check their increase, because they were more apt to learn,
more thrifty in their habits, and far less infected by Eastern vices than their
Mahommedan neighbours. They were the one indigenous population in
Western Asia which, much as adversity had injured them, showed a capacity
for moral as well as intellectual progress, and for assimilating the civilization
of the West. In their hands the industrial future of Western Asia lay,
whatever government might be established there; and those who had marked
the tenacity and robust qualities of the race looked to them to restore prosperity
to these once populous and flourishing countries when the blighting
shadow of Turkish rule had passed away. But now, after eighteen years
of constantly increasing misery, a large part, and, in many districts, the best
part, of this race has been destroyed, and the remnant is threatened with
extinction.”</p>

<p>These remarks made in 1896 by a great and disinterested authority
with a profound knowledge of the subject he was writing about, stand as true
to-day as when they were written. From 1896 onwards, events following
in succession one upon another have proved the truth and soundness of his
opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!</p>

<p>The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-seated.
In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.</p>

<p>The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which does not make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of mankind.</p>

<p>To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to: “No
Mahommedan race or dynasty has ever shown itself able to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.”</p>

<p>Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God’s elect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen” which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen” of its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough&mdash;<i>Cela suffit</i>.</p>

<p>To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
“faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
“unbelievers” absolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evil, is, the
large neighbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.</p>

<p>Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.</p>

<p>The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces inhabited
by them might ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.</p>

<h3>OPEN LETTER TO THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Excellent Sir</span>,</p>

<p>You are the President of the mighty Republic of the United States of
America, and I am only an obscure unit of a forlorn and helpless nation, but
encouraged by the intrinsic qualities of your head and heart, and also by the
record of great and noble services rendered in the cause of oppressed

present occupant.</p>

<p>Your immediate predecessor rendered a great service in the interests
of Humanity, by bringing a terrible and bloody war to its close. His staunch
strong hand of friendship was held out to the gallant nation fighting heroically
for its national existence, whilst the might of his iron will strenuously contested
and made the peace which will ever be associated with his name, but
there was a peace which his great heart wished to break but could not
succeed in breaking, and which his upright mind has branded as
“infamous”: such are his own words “the infamous peace kept by the joint
action of the great powers, while Turkey inflicted the last horrors of butchery,
torture and outrage upon the men, women and children of despairing
Armenia.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> For thirty-one years the great European Powers kept up
by joint action an infamous peace, and out of regard for their own selfish
interests allowed a corrupt, vicious, gangrened and blood-thirsty power to
wreak its hellish atrocities not only on the men, but on the women and
children of a helpless nation.</p>

<p>These are strong words, but they are true, and you will agree with me
that the meanest and humblest of God’s creatures has a right to speak the
truth, and that greatest is the right to speak the truth, when it is spoken in
the cause of murdered, outraged and misery-stricken humanity.</p>

<p>The yoke of Turkey rivetted on the necks of the Armenians by England
in 1878, was rivetted again by Russia, and yet again rivetted by Germany.
The political interests and the commercial interests of Europe have trampled
us under foot; we have been sacrificed on the altar of the political animosities
of England and Russia, and given over, men, women and children to butchery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
slaughter, imprisonment, torture; we have been crushed under the iron
wheels of the Baghdad railway, a greater Juggernauth for us, while the ex-Sultan
received his payment and “bartered a kingdom for the Kaiser’s
friendship”; and yet again we have been crushed when British diplomacy
checkmated William of Hohenzollern’s dream.</p>

<p>The death warrant of our bleeding nation has found no place on the
table of the Hague Conference of Peace and Civilization since the selfish
interests of the European Powers would give it no abiding room. President
of a great and free Republic, let it be the work of your mighty hands to lay it
there. The Cabinets of Europe have turned a deaf ear to the death shriek
of our bleeding nation, let our despairing cry be heard now in the Senate of
the United States of America.</p>

<p>It remains for the historian of the future to record the Armenian
Massacres as the foulest blot and the blackest stain on European Civilization
and European International Morality, but in addressing you now I will turn
down the pages of the hideous Past, and humbly lay open the pages of the
Present, on which is clearly written the deadly peril in which our nation stands:
the book is open, and who will may read. For it is not the goodwill of the
new régime that has to be taken into calculation, as far as the Armenians
are concerned, but the powerfulness or the powerlessness of the new régime
to make for their protection.</p>

<p>How can we forget Adana? A whole town and villages sacked and
desolated; fifty thousand of our men, women and children done to horrible
deaths, and the residue left to homelessness and starvation. How can we
forget that the arch-enemy of Christian and liberal Turk still lives, dethroned but
not executed, and that through fear of his worshippers and his adherents the
liberal Turks are compelled to pamper and support the monster assassin
of the world? When such difficulties beset the path of the liberal Turks,
the rulers, what security is there for a subject people, alien in race and
religion?</p>

<p>President of a great and free Republic, we need a friend, we ask for
your mighty hands to be held out to us in succour, since the number of our
enemies are legion: even Nature has arrayed herself against us in the
inexorable conditions of the physical geography of our country. Shall the
President of a mighty Republic with noble traditions; shall the christian men
and women of the United States leave us to our terrible fate?</p>

<p>“To serve Armenia is to serve Civilization.” These words were
spoken by a great and revered statesman; the noble handiwork of his
Creator (William Ewart Gladstone), now gone to his honored rest. “Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not let me be told that one nation has no authority over another” was his
reply to the Armenian deputation which waited on him in 1894. Let his
reply be your answer to us now, President of a mighty Republic; let it be
your answer written in golden letters across the banner of that great
civilization, of which you are the presiding head.</p>

<p>The Republic of the United States of America has been compared to
that grain of mustard seed, which when planted in the earth budded forth
and grew into such dimensions that the birds of the air lodged under the
branches thereof. I pray that the shadow of those branches be extended
over my bleeding nation.</p>

<h3>ABDUL HAMID, THE TRIUMPH OF CRIME.</h3>

<p>A monster assassin! Has he been brought before the bar of his
country, tried and condemned to the penalty of death, such as in the days
of his power he meted out to hundreds of thousands of innocents? Has he
been cast into a loathsome prison, such as the many in which thousands of
his victims have rotted and died? Nay! not so! it is not so decreed in
Turkey.</p>

<p>In Turkey, a camarilla of murderous and plundering pashas, and a
fanatical and marauding populace stand behind a Padishah who knew how to
furnish gratification for the murdering and marauding instincts of his
adherents. Nay! neither death nor imprisonment for the Padishah whose
sovereignty was the most auspicious for brigandage and murder. Who
dares to slay or imprison the demigod of rapine and despotism? Such
things cannot be done in Turkey.</p>

<p>For crimes that were in comparison as light as air, those puerile tyrants,
Charles of England and Louis of France forfeited their heads. Poor Charles
and Louis! Your heads chopped off and your bodies trundled away in a
cart: no glorifying spiritualized titles of Zeid and Imam read out in your bills
of indictment; such glorifying spiritualized titles are reserved for monster
assassins in Turkey.</p>

<p>In Turkey, a monster assassin whose list of murders rank him as premier
assassin of the world, who under heel of iron and fire annihilated the rights
and liberties of his subjects is pensioned off to live in purple and fare sumptuously:
housed in a luxurious palace, he sits on carpeted divans, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by silken and velvet pillows, with eleven ministering houris, the youngest
and fairest of his past entourage, to solace the “dolce far niente” of his
deposed Padishahdom. Ample leisure, possible opportunities to hatch plots
for the subversion of law and order, and the revival of the reign of plunder
and massacre. But it is so allowed in Turkey. It is enough to be a Caliph
and a Padishah to be able to count victims, not by thousands, but by hundreds
of thousands, and remain immune from punishment for mountains of crime.</p>

<p>What evil, what woe and desolation hast thou not wrought, spiritualized
Zeid and Imam, Caliph and Padishah? And yet thou art allowed to live!
Evil genius of thy people! thou hast worked out their moral degradation to
the lowest depths that a nation could fall; but limitless evil, supremest woe,
hast thou worked over the nation whose country thou turned into a charnel
house of slaughter, and over whom thy reign of thirty-three years hung like
a pestilence. Who can count the multitude of thy crimes against them, who
can measure the height and the depth of the woe that thou laid over their
lives. Hearths and homes pillaged and desolated, harvest fields turned into
rivers of blood, not thousands upon thousands, but hundreds of thousands of
men, women, and children tortured with devilish ingenuities of torture, imprisoned
in loathsome dungeons, outraged, butchered, slaughtered, hunted
like wild beasts, left to homelessness and starvation.</p>

<p>Enough blood to drown a leprous souled and gangrened souled Padishah
and his gangrened pack of followers! Enough crime to hang a Caliph!</p>

<p>Out with thy Caliphate! even by the law of thy prophet, that fierce son
of the desert, the Caliph is ordained protector of the weak and helpless;
what didst thou with thy thirty-three years of Caliphal power, except crush
the weak and annihilate the helpless.</p>

<p>The very earth has echoed with the dying cry of the least of them, those
“christian puppies” with little bodies piled up one upon another, and little
heads struck off together at one stroke; with the frenzied shrieks of mothers
who have seen with their own eyes the slaughter of their children, with the
anguished wail of women, with the death groans of youth and old age. Aye!
the very earth has echoed with the dying gasp of that righteous man, the
venerable sire of his people, the renowned nonagenarian whom thou stealthily
silenced on a bloody bed into the sleep of death for trying to save his flock
from thy hyena jaws.</p>

<p>An explosive bomb shattered the life of thy crowned opponent, (a noble
life consecrated to the welfare of his people) but no chance or opportunity
directed any explosive bomb to shatter thy cadaverous body. No jeweled
pistol or secret dagger like the many that have dripped with the blood of thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.</p>

<p>Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another; by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Peerless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of the Triumph of Crime.</p>

<hr />

<h2>L’AVENIR.</h2>

<p>In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.</p>

<p>It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.</p>

<p>The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolutionaries,
or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his minions could not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Armenian Massacres of Abdul Hamid were tentative; he
began by feeling the pulse of Europe; he found that the six Signatories to
the Treaty of Berlin accepted the situation, he was thus emboldened to
carry out that long and awful list of horrors that stands without its parallel
in history. Clearly it was in the power of Europe to have prevented both
the massacres and all the agonizing sufferings that came in their train, but
Europe took no preventive action.</p>

<p>Let us ask the question, Who and what are these Turks, whom Europe
for her own sordid ends has petted and pampered and helped and supported?
and the answer comes with striking force to-day over the lapse of a century,
in the words of one of England’s greatest sons: “I have never before heard
that the Turkish Empire has been considered any part of the balance of
Powers in Europe. They despise and contemn all Christian princes as
infidels, and only wish to subdue and exterminate them and their people.
What have these worse than savages to do with the Powers of Europe but
to spread war, destruction, and pestilence among them? The Ministers and
the policy which shall give these people any weight in Europe will deserve
all the bans and curses of posterity.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>To-day the Powers of Europe are armed to the teeth. To-day they are
groaning under the burden of armaments which they are increasing with
breathless speed although the burden grows heavier. To-day all Europe is
trembling lest the hell-hounds of war be let loose. Has any political student
put his finger on the cause which began, the beginning and the source of the
evil, the Alpha of the Omega. I have put my finger on it&mdash;the beginning and
the source&mdash;The jealousies and rivalries of European Politics in the Turkish
Empire. According to an Eastern proverb “The flies are always round the
honey,” but sometimes the flies stick in the honey.</p>

<p>Politicians of the Governments of Europe have said in the pride of their
hearts “There is no God.” Particularly has this spirit of cynicism and
heartlessness governed the actions of Russian politicians after the death of
Alexander II. Since 1881, they have looked upon the extermination of the
Armenians just as the pathfinder in a forest would look upon a dense forest
growth, the clearing away of which would make out a path for him and lead
to running streams and harvest fields. In the eyes of Russian politicians
the unfortunate Armenians have been the forest growth which has stood in
the way of their advance to the South and into Persia, and they have looked
on with intense satisfaction at the exterminating process of the Turk, which
they have regarded as the helping hand that clears away the difficulty confronting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
them. But precisely whether Russia can grow strong by the pouring
out of Armenian blood, and whether her empire will be extended by
their hellish extermination remains to be solved by the future. One thing,
however, the history of the world points out, that iniquity ends, not in
strength, but in dissolution; and “The wages of sin is death.”</p>

<p>Politicians of Europe have, in the pride of their hearts, arrogated to
themselves that power, which appertains to the Creator; they have imagined
that they hold the world in the hollows of their hands, and the misery or
happiness of millions of human beings has weighed as nothing in their
estimation, against the interests of what they have designated “our sphere
of influence,” but they have forgotten what they need to be reminded that
the Creator is mightier than the creature and that the eternal law of heaven
and earth changeth not for politicians.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE ARMENIANS&mdash;THE INTRODUCTION
OF CHRISTIANITY INTO ARMENIA&mdash;DECLINE
&amp; GRAND REVIVAL.</h2>

<p>“God shall enlarge Japhet and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be his servant.”</p>

<p>For the interpretation of this blessing of Noah’s to his eldest son, and
of how it may or may not have met with its fulfilment, I shall leave to
theologians to discuss, and only record it here as a quotation from Genesis.
Beyond the story of his connection with the flood, and this blessing with
which his father blessed him, and the genealogy of his sons, we read nothing
more in Genesis, of Japhet, this mighty father of the Caucasian race.</p>

<p>The genealogy in Genesis runs thus:</p>

<p>“The sons of Japhet, Gomer and Magog and Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and Meschech, and Tiras.</p>

<p>“And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.</p>

<p>“And the sons of Javan; Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodamin.</p>

<p>“By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every
one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.”</p>

<p>Only the names of the three sons of Gomer, and the four sons of
Javan are given in Genesis, and by these we are told were the isles of the
Gentiles divided. So much for Genesis.</p>

<p>Later history records that these Gentiles spread themselves over part
of that stretch of terra firma which now goes by the name of Europe, developing
their own families, and their own nations, and originating their own
tongues, and also they spread themselves over other parts of the surface of
the globe, populating where they could, ruling where they could.</p>

<p>But through the roll of centuries which lost themselves into the flight of
thousand years, one branch of the sons of Japhet kept themselves on the land
where Noah planted his vineyard, and round the base of that mountain from
whence his descendants began to spread and people the earth.</p>

<p>Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
in Armenia. “No aighee” (Noah’s vineyard) is the name of a village
supposed to be the place where the patriarch planted his vine; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“Nakhitchvan”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
meaning (first
descent) where
Noah is supposed
to have descended
from the ark; also
“Mairand” meaning
(mother is
there) where
Noah’s wife is supposed
to be buried;
and “Erivan”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
meaning (that
which can be seen)
supposed to be the
land in the distance
which could be
seen when Noah
descended from
the ark.</p>

<p class="caption">MINARET AT ERIVAN, ONE OF THE CITIES TRADITION
ASCRIBES TO BE FOUNDED BY NOAH.</p>

</div>

<p>Armenian history
begins with
Haik, the first chief
or king of the
tribe: he was third
in descent from
Japhet, and fourth in descent from Noah, and his genealogy is given thus:
Haik the son of Togarmah, the son of Gomer, the son of Japhet, the son of
Noah.</p>

<p>“They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and
horsemen and mules” is the designation given by Ezekiel, 27th chapter 14th
verse of the merchants of Armenia trading with Tyrus.</p>

<p>Haik revolting from Belus, the Nimrod of Genesis, the son of Cush and
grandson of Ham, retraced his footsteps from the plains of Shinar, where he
with others had tried to build the tower whose top should reach into heaven,
and with his followers and children settled himself round the base of Ararat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps a nascent fire of patriotism was burning in Haik’s heart as he
retraced his steps to the land of his father’s or grandfather’s childhood:
perhaps owing to the circumstances under which he was placed, he had not
the alternative of another choice.</p>

<p>We read in Armenian history that Belus sent the following message
to Haik:</p>

<p>“Why didst thou go to that cold country? Were it not better for
thee to have moderated thy pride, and submissively dwelt on my territory
in any part thou wished.”</p>

<p>To which Haik replied:</p>

<p>“It is better to die bravely than to bow down in fear to that presumptuous
man who would be worshipped as a god.”</p>

<p>Whatever causes may have influenced Haik, his choice of country was
geographically most unfortunate for the race he founded, and it may truly be
said that owing to its geographical conditions affording facilities for the
march of conquerors, to have been instrumental in bringing about the overwhelming
and unequalled adversities that through weary centuries have
followed like a grim fate the footsteps of his descendants.</p>

<p>No geographical position on the surface of the globe could have been
more unfortunate, hemmed round by larger territories, with no natural
defences or boundaries, and no outlet to the sea, except the lake of the
Caspian on the one side, and the lake of the Black Sea on the other, that
land on which Haik chose to found a country and a nation, has been soaked
with the blood and the tears of this branch of the sons of Japhet.</p>

<p>The animosity between Haik and Belus continued, and later, according
to Armenian historians, Belus was slain in battle by an arrow from the bow
of Haik.</p>

<p>We read the following record of Belus in Genesis: “he began to be a
mighty one in the earth.” “He was a mighty hunter before the Lord:
wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.”</p>

<p>In Armenian history, Haik is depicted as a man of powerful physique
and gigantic stature; no man of his time being able to bend his bow or
shoot his arrow. Moses of Chorene, the chief of Armenian historians,
quoting from the learned Syrian Mar Abbas, writes of him thus:</p>

<p>“He was graceful and well built, curly haired, pleasing in appearance,
and strong armed, and it might be remembered that among the heroes of
his time he was the most remarkable of all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>However that may be, Armenian history awards to Haik the proud
distinction of having overcome and slain Belus, the mighty hunter Nimrod.</p>

<p>The people who retraced their steps from the plains of Shinar, and
settled round the base of Ararat called themselves “Hai” after their chief,
and they named their country “Haiyastan,” and these names still continue
to be used in the Armenian, or “Haiyérane” as the Armenians call their
own language.</p>

<p class="caption">GREAT AND LITTLE ARARAT.</p>

</div>

<p>I will pass over the periods when the son and grandson of Haik ruled
over Armenia, and only mention that the mountain known to the world as
Ararat was called by the Hai “Masis” after their king Amasia and great-grandson
of Haik. To this day, Armenian peasants and others dwelling
round Ararat, call the mountain “Masis.” I remember in my childhood
having seen an Armenian periodical entitled “Masis,” which showed that the
name had been steadily kept up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.</p>

<p>He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.</p>

<p>The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia; the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
whole of Cappadocia fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an eager enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultivate his friendship.</p>

<p>No doubt if the volumes and scripts of paper or parchment of the famous
Alexandrian library, which burned for six months as fuel in the four thousand
baths of the city, had escaped that most atrocious act of vandalism, and been
preserved instead, vast treasures of knowledge now lost to us concerning
the ancient kingdoms of Western Asia might be known in our day; and also
when the tide of Islam victory rolled over the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story and history of the people was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction of their independence it would be difficult now to calculate
or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there seems to be grounds for supposing that the “Aramæans”
designated by foreign writers as “a people of Semitic race, language and
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia”
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, <i>in the parts above Assyria</i>.</p>

<p>Archæological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites; the modern Armenian being supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to be the survival of the ancient Hittite tongue, and it is asserted almost
everything that is known in the Hittite language is Old Armenian in form:
but who these Hittites were, or whence they came neither historian nor
archæologist have been able definitely to ascertain. In the Armenian
version of the Bible, we find the name “Kethosi” used for the Hittite who
were known to the Assyrians and Egyptians as “Ketha,” but this can have
no important bearing since the Bible was translated into the Armenian
language from the Greek in the fifth century of the Christian era, and the
Armenian scribe no doubt simply translated what he found in the Greek.</p>

<p>According, however, to all known history the Hittites were a warlike
and conquering race and ranked among the foremost of the nations of Western
Asia. The modern historian has come to the following conclusion concerning
them: “Their primitive home is thought to have been in that part of
Armenia where the Euphrates, the Halys, and Lycus approach nearest
to one another; and it is even asserted that the modern Armenians are
descendants of the old Hittites. From this point they began their career
of conquests, probably under the leadership of some able and vigorous chief,
whose ambition overleaped his native boundaries. One conquest led to
another. Their leaders acquired great armies, and subdued many nations,
until the Hittites became one of the most powerful peoples of ancient times,
and their kings were able successfully to defy even Egypt, at that time the
strongest nation on the globe.”</p>

<p>This description accords with Armenian history; the Hai being known
from time immemorial as a warlike race, and extending their territory by
conquests, until, as I have narrated, under the leadership of Aram their
kingdom spread from the mountains of Upper Armenia to the shores of the
Mediterranean and into northern Mesopotamia, which proves that almost all
of Asia Minor was conquered by them, and according also to Armenian
history the language of the Hai was introduced into Cappadocia by King

<p>Allowing, however, for the many obscurities of Armenian history, confusion
comes in, when historians or archæologists ascribe a Mongolian
ancestry to the Hittites, whereas Armenian history holds its unquestionable
ground firmly and decidedly on the Japhetian ancestry; and the peculiar
physiognomy of the Armenians; the oval contour of face, the distinctive,
prominent nose, large eye, and well marked arch of eyebrow do not show any
traces of Mongolian ancestry. It follows therefore that if the Armenians are
the descendants of the Hittites, then the Hittites were not of Mongolian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ancestry. If the Hittites were the Hai, the name must have undergone
corruption during the course of centuries and it is reasonable to suppose
that they shared the fate of all conquerors, and after a period of power,
were driven back from the shores of the Mediterranean to their own native
home.</p>

<p>Aram was succeeded by his son Ara, a prince of such singular and
surpassing beauty that he was surnamed “Ara the Beautiful.” The famous
Semiramis, wife of Ninus king of Assyria, attracted by his great personal
beauty offered him her affections and her throne after the death of her
husband, but her proffers of love were scornfully rejected by Ara, who
according to the story related of his own love was passionately attached to
his queen Nuvard. The proud Semiramis, scorned, enraged and mortified,
declared war against Ara and entered his country with her armies; a battle
was fought in which Ara leading his army was slain, although Semiramis
had given special instructions to her troops to be careful of his life and bring
him to her a living prisoner.</p>

<p>The death of Ara was evidently a grief to Semiramis, for she established
his son Kardos on his father’s throne. She also built a town and fortress
on the shores of Lake Aghthamar, now called Van, the battlefield on which
the beautiful Ara pursued by her fatal love lost his life. The town and
fortress were named “Semiramakert” meaning “built by Semiramis.”</p>

<p>The name of the highest mountain in Armenia which the people of the
country called “Masis” came to be known as Ararat, it is supposed to be
derived from the Armenian words “Ara-i-jard” meaning “the defeat of
Ara” or “the undoing of Ara.” If this version is correct, the name is
likely to have been used in derision by the Assyrians. According to another
version the name of Ara was converted into Ararat, and the country called
after him. Thus we read in the account of the flood given in Genesis:</p>

<p>“And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.”</p>

<p>In the Armenian version of the bible, we read “on the twenty-seventh
day of the month,” but likewise as in English “upon the mountains of
Ararat.” This is not surprising since the designation “thaghavoroothune
Araratian” meaning “the kingdom of Ararat” is in use in the Armenian
language.</p>

<p>I have alluded to the reigns of Aram and Ara to show how the Hai
have come to be called Armenians and how their country has come to be
named Armenia; also whence the name, Ararat; and as I purport here
only to treat of the origin of the Armenians, I shall now pass on to the no
less interesting period of their history:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> THE INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>

<p>When that great event bearing the message “on earth peace, goodwill
toward men” celebrated throughout the Christian world as the divine birth,
took place in the city of Bethlehem; Abgar the son of Arsham reigned in
Armenia.</p>

<p>That country was now broken in
strength, the severe blows dealt on the one
side by the Roman Empire, and the incessant
warfare of the Persian on the other,
had greatly curtailed her former independence
and power; the talons of the Roman
Eagles were already felt in her vitals, and
the king of Armenia subsisted under the
favor of the Roman Emperor, whilst it
became necessary for him to cultivate the
friendship of his powerful neighbour, the
king of Persia.</p>

<p>Whilst in Persian territory, whither he
had gone to settle the dispute that had
arisen on the death of the Persian monarch
between his sons, Abgar had contracted a
severe disease, evidently leprosy.</p>

<p class="caption">ABGAR KING OF ARMENIA.</p>

<p class="caption2">Converted to Christianity in A.D. 34.
Baptised by the Apostle Thaddeus.</p>

</div>

<p>The wonderful cures and miracles of
Christ were reported to him by the representatives
he had sent to the Roman General Marinus in Jerusalem.
These representatives had gone to refute the charges brought against him by
King Herod, and to propitiate the Roman Power; they came back to tell
what they had witnessed in Jerusalem, of the singular wisdom and wondrous
works of a marvellous man named Jesus, who was of Nazareth, but whom
his own followers persisted in calling the Son of God.</p>

<p>The story relates that Abgar was deeply impressed by what he heard,
and expressed his own belief that man could not do such wondrous works as
were related of this Jesus the Nazarene. Thereupon the King sent messengers
to Jerusalem with a letter to Jesus. What a touch of human nature
is here displayed; the king is suffering from a loathsome disease, the medical
skill of his country and of neighbouring countries has been exhausted, all in
vain; the royal heart is stricken as well as the royal body, for his disease is
so loathsome, that although he is king, his subjects would rather shun than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
approach him; he hears of this wonderful man Jesus, his representatives
have come back from Jerusalem to tell him that “he cleanseth the lepers.”
Hasten to him, said the king, take unto him my greetings, carry my messages
and my letter and bring him unto me that I might honor him and if so be
that he may heal me.</p>

<p>The messengers of Abgar were headed by Anany the Greek scribe of
the king and they are supposed to be present in the procession of Christ’s
entry into Jerusalem. The twentieth and twenty-first verses of the Gospel
of St. John are adduced by Armenian historians as corroborative testimony:</p>

<p>“And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
at the feast;</p>

<p>“The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee,
and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.”</p>

<p>Anany and his companions are supposed to be the “certain Greeks”
who came to Philip asking to see Jesus. And here I have to explain that the
letters of the Armenian alphabet were invented by St. Mesrope in the beginning
of the fifth century of the christian era; previous to the time of Mesrope
there were no special Armenian letters, and as this invention was hailed as
a signal national boon we have to conclude that there was no written
Armenian language previous to the fifth century. One thing however must
be certain, that this letter carried by the king’s Greek scribe, the leader of the
messengers, must originally have been written in Greek. This letter has
already been translated from the Armenian into English; the translation
reads thus:</p>

<p>“Abgar the son of Arsham, Prince of Armenia, sends to Thee, Saviour
and Benefactor, Jesus, who didst perform miracles in Jerusalem, greeting.</p>

<p>“I have heard of Thee, and of the cures wrought by Thee without herbs
or medicines; for it is reported that Thou restoreth the blind and maketh
the lame walk, cleanseth the lepers, casteth out devils and unclean spirits,
and healeth those that are tormented of diseases of long continuance, and
that Thou also raiseth the dead:&mdash;hearing all this of Thee I was fully
persuaded that Thou art the very God come down from heaven to do such
miracles, or that Thou art the Son of God and so performeth them; wherefore
I write to Thee to entreat Thee to take the trouble to come to me and
cure my disease. Besides, I hear that the Jews murmur against Thee and
want to torture Thee. I have a small and beautiful city&mdash;sufficient for us
both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The story goes on to relate that among the messengers was an artist
by the name of John who had been commissioned by the king to bring back
a portrait of Christ; the artist however failed in his efforts to portray the
divine features, whereupon Christ gave him a veil which he had laid to his
face and on which his features had become imprinted, to carry back to his
master.</p>

<p>We are also told that the apostle Thomas was commanded by Christ to
write a reply to Abgar. The reply has also been translated into English
and the translation reads thus:</p>

<p>“Blessed is he who believes in Me without seeing Me, for it is written
of Me that they that see Me shall not believe, and they that have not seen
Me shall believe and be saved. As concerning the request that I should
come to thee, it becomes Me to fulfil all things for which I was sent, and
when I have fulfilled those then I shall ascend to Him that sent me; but
after my Ascension I will send one of my disciples, who shall cure thee of
thy disease and give life to thee and to all those that are with thee.”</p>

<p>Two stories are given of the cure of Abgar. According to one version
he was healed on receiving the veil, according to the other, the apostle
Thaddeus on coming to Armenia laid his hands on the king and cured him.</p>

<p>This story of the veil has been treated by certain scholars as a legend,
especially as the Roman church has also got a somewhat similar story. We
are of course not in a position to vouch for its truth or incorrectness, but it
seems to me if all the miracles of Christ as related in the gospels are to be
credited, this one also can be regarded as one out of many. If according to
the gospel story water was turned into wine at the marriage feast in Cana,
what is there incredible about the imprint of the divine features on a veil;
and if the gospels assure us of the healing of many lepers there can be
nothing astonishing in the healing of the king of Armenia.</p>

<p>I was however much interested when I came across the following
passage in the history of the “Spread of Islam”:</p>

<p>“To the east they advanced to the banks and sources of the Euphrates
and Tigris; the long disputed barrier of Rome and Persia was forever confounded;
the walls of Edessa and Amida, of Dara and Nisibis, which had
resisted the arms and engines of Sapor or Nushirvan, were levelled in the
dust; and the holy city of Abgarus might vainly produce the epistle or the
image of Christ to an unbelieving conqueror.”</p>

<p>“The long disputed barrier of Rome and Persia” which was “forever
confounded” was of course Armenia; and “the holy city of Abgarus” the
historian evidently had in his mind must have been Edessa, whither Abgar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had removed his seat of government. To Armenians, however, Edessa has
never been “the holy city,” if they had a holy city, they would prefer to
name Ani, the city of a thousand churches, or on account of its peculiar
associations Etchmiatzin the ecclesiastical metropolis.</p>

<p>It was in Anno Domini 34 that the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew
went to Armenia, where they were warmly welcomed and received with
great reverence and respect by the King, who accepted the christian faith at
once, himself and the royal household being baptised by the apostle
Thaddeus.</p>

<p>Thaddeus and Bartholomew continued their preaching in Armenia,
converting and baptising the people; churches were raised up, bishops
consecrated, and the christian religion established in the country.</p>

<p>It might have been a matter of wonder to us why Saint Paul did not
address an epistle to the Armenians as he addressed to other nations; but
I think the 20th verse of the 15th chapter of his epistle to the Romans
clearly explains the reason why there was not an epistle written to the
Armenians also:</p>

<p>“Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was
named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.”</p>

<p>Clearly then no epistle was written to the Armenians because Christ
was already named among them, and Paul did not wish to build upon the
foundation of Thaddeus and Bartholomew who had laid the foundation of
Christianity in Armenia at a time when Paul himself was persecuting
Christians. Thaddeus and Bartholomew left behind no epistles, and we
have only Armenian history for the record of the work they did in Armenia.</p>

<p>Abgar died soon after his baptism and conversion, and was succeeded
by his son Anany who tried to revive the old religion, which was something
similar to the worship of the Greeks and Romans. The people of the
country however had in large part accepted Christianity, and the revival of
the old religion was consequently met with disfavour, but before their
discontent had time to assume active tendencies Anany met his death by an
accident; the people thereupon immediately invited Abgar’s nephew Sanatrook
to occupy the throne, taking a pledge from him that he would not
interfere with their religion. The pledge was readily given by Sanatrook,
but once secure on the throne he proved a cruel and merciless despot: the
remaining sons of Abgar were killed, and his daughters and widow Helena
banished, but the crowning act of the tyrant’s wickedness and infamy was
the martyrdom of the apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew. Thus Christianity
continued its struggles in Armenia, persecuted and declining, but still enduring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>About Anno Domini 260 the king reigning in Armenia by the name of
Terdat, persecuted Christianity. He had regained his throne through the
support of the Roman Army, and to celebrate his accession he offered thanksgiving
and sacrifice in the temple of the goddess Anahid, which was no other
than the goddess Diana of the Romans, but the fathers of the Armenian
church in their christian zeal have reversed the name of the goddess, made
a topsy-turvy of it, calling her Anahid, and so the name has remained in the
Armenian language to this day.</p>

<p>This occasion of the king’s worship and
thanksgiving in the temple of Diana, marked the
beginning of the persecution of Gregory, afterwards
known as Gregory the Illuminator and the
patron saint of Armenia. The childhood of
Gregory had been shadowed by a parent’s guilt:
his father Anak having treacherously assassinated
the then reigning king Khosrov the Great,
the whole family was exterminated, only two
sons escaping death, one of them, Gregory, was
secretly removed by his nurse to Caesaria, and
kept in concealment, until in the course of years
the father’s crime having been forgotten, all
danger for the life of the son was supposed to
have passed away.</p>

<p class="caption">(St. Gregory the Illuminator)</p>

<p class="caption2">Patron Saint of Armenia. Revived
Christianity in Armenia
in A.D. 276.</p>

</div>

<p>Gregory’s christian faith however now became
the cause of his misfortunes; the king
called upon Gregory to assist in the worship in
the temple of Diana, but he firmly refused and
boldly avowed his christianity, which so incensed
the king that he ordered frightful tortures to be
inflicted upon him, but as the tortures had no
effect and Gregory remained firm to his faith,
the king ordered him to be thrown into a dry
well. The story goes on to relate that Gregory
lived for fifteen years in this dry well, food and
drink being conveyed to him secretly by a
woman, herself a christian. On this spot is built
the famous monastery of “Khorvirap” meaning
“deep well.”</p>

<p>A beautiful Roman maiden by the name of Rhipsimè fleeing from the
addresses of the Emperor Diocletian sought refuge in Armenia; she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
accompanied by a friend, a woman of maturer years of the name of Caiana,
and some other christian maidens, all fleeing from persecution in Rome.</p>

<p>Rhipsimè’s rare beauty had captivated the Roman emperor, and she
had sought to escape from his passion by flight, but a crueller fate awaited
her in Armenia, for king Terdat in his turn smitten by the exquisite beauty
of her face offered to make her his queen, and her refusal to accept his throne
and his love so exasperated the king that he ordered her beautiful head to
be cut off. Thus Rhipsimè with Caiana and their young companions were
cruelly martyred. Rhipsimè and Caiana were later beatified as saints in
the Armenian church.</p>

<p>The king however did not escape the Nemesis of his diabolical crime,
the memory of the beautiful Rhipsimè haunted him; remorse took the place
of the ferocious anger that had doomed his hapless victim to her cruel death
and the king lost his reason. The king having become incapacitated,
Gregory was released from his underground prison by the king’s sister
Khosrovidookt, and as the malady of the king was mental, remorse for his
own crime having overturned his reason, it became the peculiar office of
Gregory to minister to the king, and by his spiritual ministrations to effect
the restoration of the royal mind.</p>

<p>Terdat recovered his reason and as a broken-hearted penitent accepted
the religion of Gregory and the beautiful Rhipsimè.</p>

<p>Gregory now freely preached Christianity in Armenia. It was a grand
Revival; the temples of Anahid were turned into the churches of Christ,
and the whole nation accepted Christianity, which became the established
religion in the country.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The name of Gregory has been handed down to
posterity as Soorb Gregore Loosavoritch (Saint Gregory the Illuminator).
“Illuminator” is the generally accepted English translation of the Armenian
term “Loosavoritch,” but it is true nevertheless that neither the term
“Illuminator” nor “Enlightener” suitably conveys the definition of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
meaning; sometimes modes of expression are so difficult to translate from
one language into another, and it can be said that the term “Illuminator” is
used for want of a better word in English. The Armenians call their
religion “loois havat;” the word “loois” means “light” and “havat”
means “faith” or “religion,” but if I translated the two words as
“enlightened faith” or “enlightened religion” the translation would not
suitably convey the meaning of the original.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL OF ETCHMIATZIN.</p>

<p class="caption">(Only Begotten Descended).</p>

<p class="caption2">Seat of the Supreme Patriarch. The foundation stone was laid by St. Gregory the
Illuminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.</p>

</div>

<p>The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
“Etchmiatzin” means in the Armenian language “the only begotten is
descended,” and the story attached to it is, that in a vision Christ appeared
to Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of “Etchmiatzin” (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through unremitting
persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
“Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest:</p>

<p>“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in 1114 to Rômklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from our holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.”</p>

<p>I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news:</p>

<p>“An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preservation
in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.</p>

them which went on for months was worse than the massacre. Their business was destroyed, they
were plundered and blackmailed without mercy, they were hunted like wild beasts, they were

1909, (“Abdul the Dethroned”) writes as follows:
</p>
<p>
“I remember the following incident which depicts the official Russian attitude: One night,
while dining at the Russian legation in Bern, Switzerland, many Russian officials being present, the
conversation was directed to the ever-engrossing Eastern question. A diplomat from St. Petersburg
expressed his admiration of Abdul Hamid, praising his extraordinary intelligence and diplomatic
skill. ‘Besides,’ he continued, ‘he is not so black as his enemies have painted him.’
</p>
<p>
“Not being able to restrain my indignation at this, I protested, saying he was an arch assassin.
‘Not to speak of his innumerable cruelties and many villainies,’ I said, ‘can you deny, Sir, that he
instigated and accomplished the annihilation of 360,000 Armenians?’
</p>
<p>
“The admirer of the Sultan smiled, but before he could answer me, the military attaché of the
legation, who was sitting next to me, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“If you condemn the Sultan for that, you astonish me. The Armenians? Bah! They ought to
be exterminated <i>en masse</i>, and the Sultan did an excellent piece of work when he got rid of them.
I have no use for them. Besides,’ he continued, ‘can’t you see that a free Armenia would be a
serious obstacle to Russian expansion and to our advance to the south and into Persia? Abdul
Hamid has proved himself a very valuable ally of Russia. He is the best Ambassador at Constantinople
that we’ve ever had.”&mdash;Note to 2nd printing.</p>

independence, persecution has scattered and dispersed the people, thousands fleeing from their
native home sought refuge in other countries and in some cases they or their descendants have
come under the influence of other churches; thus the Mukhitharian monks of the monastery of St.
Lazar in Venice have been drawn into the Romish Church and their influence has been extended
over a small minority of laymen; also the influence of the American Missionaries in Asiatic Turkey
has drawn others into Protestantism, but the bulk of the nation has remained Gregorians. It is
well to remark here however that the orthodox Church, although calling herself “The Holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church” has devoted her energies mainly to upholding the essential
principles of Christianity and has not concerned herself much about dogmas. As for the modern
Armenians of the Gregorian Church their religious views are characterized by liberalism, they look
to the central figure of Christianity and regard dogmas as immaterial: their jealousy of their
church is only actuated by the passionate feeling of preserving nationalism. They regard their
church as the ark in which nationalism may be preserved until the dawn of better days.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
